@article{Acin2011,
  abstract      = {According to quantum theory, the outcomes obtained by measuring an entangled state necessarily exhibit some randomness if they violate a Bell inequality. In particular, a maximal violation of the CHSH inequality guarantees that 1.23 bits of randomness are generated by the measurements. However, by performing measurements with binary outcomes on two subsystems one could in principle generate up to two bits of randomness. We show that correlations that violate arbitrarily little the CHSH inequality or states with arbitrarily little entanglement can be used to certify that close to the maximum of two bits of randomness are produced. Our results show that non-locality, entanglement, and the amount of randomness that can be certified in a Bell-type experiment are inequivalent quantities. From a practical point of view, they imply that device-independent quantum key distribution with optimal key generation rate is possible using almost-local correlations and that device-independent randomness generation with optimal rate is possible with almost-local correlations and with almost-unentangled states.},

@article{adami97,
  abstract      = {We discuss the capacity of quantum channels for information transmission and storage. Quantum channels have dual uses: they can be used to transmit known quantum states which code for classical information, and they can be used in a purely quantum manner, for transmitting or storing quantum entanglement. We propose here a definition of the von Neumann capacity of quantum channels, which is a quantum mechanical extension of the Shannon capacity and reverts to it in the classical limit. As such, the von Neumann capacity assumes the role of a classical or quantum capacity depending on the usage of the channel. In analogy to the classical construction, this capacity is defined as the maximum von Neumann mutual entropy processed by the channel, a measure which reduces to the capacity for classical information transmission through quantum channels (the "Kholevo capacity") when known quantum states are sent. The quantum mutual entropy fulfills all basic requirements for a measure of information, and observes quantum data-processing inequalities. We also derive a quantum Fano inequality relating the quantum loss of the channel to the fidelity of the quantum code. The quantities introduced are calculated explicitly for the quantum "depolarizing" channel. The von Neumann capacity is interpreted within the context of superdense coding, and an "extended" Hamming bound is derived that is consistent with that capacity.},

We show that such a scheme is equivalent to a "unitary 2-design" [Dankert et al.], as opposed to normal encryption which is a unitary 1-design. Our other main results include a new proof of the lower bound of (d{\^{}}2-1){\^{}}2+1 on the number of unitaries in a 2-design [Gross et al.], which lends itself to a generalization to approximate 2-design. Furthermore, while in prime power dimension there is a unitary 2-design with =< d{\^{}}5 elements, we show that there are always approximate 2-designs with O(epsilon{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}} d{\^{}}4 log d) elements.},

@article{audenaert12,
  abstract      = {In the problem of quantum state discrimination, one has to determine by measurements the state of a quantum system, based on the a priori side information that the true state is one of two given and completely known states, rho or sigma. In general, it is not possible to decide the identity of the true state with certainty, and the optimal measurement strategy depends on whether the two possible errors (mistaking rho for sigma, or the other way around) are treated as of equal importance or not. Recent results on the quantum Chernoff and Hoeffding bounds show that, if several copies of the system are available then the optimal error probabilities decay exponentially in the number of copies, and the decay rate is given by a certain statistical distance between rho and sigma (the Chernoff distance and the Hoeffding distances, respectively). While these results provide a complete solution for the asymptotic problem, they are not completely satisfying from a practical point of view. Indeed, in realistic scenarios one has access only to finitely many copies of a system, and therefore it is desirable to have bounds on the error probabilities for finite sample size. In this paper we provide finite-size bounds on the so-called Stein errors, the Chernoff errors, the Hoeffding errors and the mixed error probabilities related to the Chernoff and the Hoeffding errors.},

  abstract      = {We consider the problem of discriminating between two different states of a finite quantum system in the setting of large numbers of copies, and find a closed form expression for the asymptotic exponential rate at which the specified error probability tends to zero. This leads to the identification of the quantum generalisation of the classical Chernoff distance. The proof relies on two new techniques that have been introduced in [quant-ph/0610027] and [quant-ph/0607216], respectively, and that are also well suited to prove the quantum generalisation of the Hoeffding bound, which is a modification of the Chernoff distance and specifies the optimal achievable asymptotic error rate in the context of asymmetric hypothesis testing. This has been done subsequently by Hayashi [quant-ph/0611013] and Nagaoka [quant-ph/0611289] for the special case where both hypotheses have full support. Moreover, quantum Stein's Lemma and quantum Sanov's theorem may be derived directly from the quantum Hoeffding bound combining it with a result obtained recently in [math/0703772]. The goal of this paper is to present the proofs of the above mentioned results in a unified way and in full generality (allowing hypothetic states with different supports). Additionally, we give an in-depth treatment of the properties of the quantum Chernoff distance. We argue that, although it is not a metric, it is a natural distance measure on the set of density operators, due to its clear operational meaning.},

If a protocol is secure regardless of the device behaviour, it can be used to generate a shared key even if the supplier of the devices is malicious. To date, all device-independent quantum key distribution protocols that are known to be secure require separate isolated devices for each entangled pair, which is a significant practical limitation. We introduce a protocol that requires Alice and Bob to have only one device each. Although inefficient, our protocol is unconditionally secure against an adversarial supplier limited only by locally enforced signalling constraints.},

Informally it states that you cannot increase the information content of a quantum system by acting on it with a local physical operation. When the smooth min-entropy is used as the relevant information measure, then the DPI follows immediately from the definition of the entropy. The DPI for the von Neumann entropy is then obtained by specializing the DPI for the smooth min-entropy by using the quantum asymptotic equipartition property (QAEP). We provide a new, simplified proof of the QAEP and therefore obtain a self-contained proof of the DPI for the von Neumann entropy.},

Our framework is based on the joint convexity of the exponential of the collision relative entropy, and is a (partial) quantum generalization of the technique of Yassaee et al. (2013) from classical information theory. Based on this framework, we derive one-shot achievable bounds for the problems of communication over classical-quantum channels, quantum hypothesis testing, and classical data compression with quantum side information. We argue that our one-shot achievable bounds are strong enough to give the asymptotic achievable rates of these problems even up to the second order.},

  abstract      = {Instantaneous measurements of non-local observables between space-like separated regions can be performed without violating causality. This feat relies on the use of entanglement. Here we propose novel protocols for this task and the related problem of multipartite quantum computation with local operations and a single round of classical communication. Compared to previously known techniques, our protocols reduce the entanglement consumption by an exponential amount. We also prove a linear lower bound on the amount of entanglement required for the implementation of a certain non-local measurement. These results relate to position-based cryptography: an amount of entanglement scaling exponentially in the number of communicated qubits is sufficient to render any such scheme insecure. Furthermore, we show that certain schemes are secure under the assumption that the adversary has less entanglement than a given linear bound and is restricted to classical communication.},

  abstract      = {Dual to the usual noisy channel coding problem, where a noisy (classical or quantum) channel is used to simulate a noiseless one, reverse Shannon theorems concern the use of noiseless channels to simulate noisy ones, and more generally the use of one noisy channel to simulate another. For channels of nonzero capacity, this simulation is always possible, but for it to be efficient, auxiliary resources of the proper kind and amount are generally required. In the classical case, shared randomness between sender and receiver is a sufficient auxiliary resource, regardless of the nature of the source, but in the quantum case the requisite auxiliary resources for efficient simulation depend on both the channel being simulated, and the source from which the channel inputs are coming. For tensor power sources (the quantum generalization of classical IID sources), entanglement in the form of standard ebits (maximally entangled pairs of qubits) is sufficient, but for general sources, which may be arbitrarily correlated or entangled across channel inputs, additional resources, such as entanglement-embezzling states or backward communication, are generally needed. Combining existing and new results, we establish the amounts of communication and auxiliary resources needed in both the classical and quantum cases, the tradeoffs among them, and the loss of simulation efficiency when auxiliary resources are absent or insufficient. In particular we find a new single-letter expression for the excess forward communication cost of simulating a quantum feedback channel on non-tensor-power sources in the presence of unlimited ebits but no other auxiliary resource. Our results on tensor power sources establish a strong converse to the entanglement-assisted capacity theorem.},

  abstract      = {In their seminal paper, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) show that an observer who is maximally entangled with the system to be measured can perfectly predict the outcome of two incompatible measurements. This feat stands in stark contrast to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle which tell us that if the observer is not entangled with the system at all, then his ability to predict the outcomes of incompatible measurements such as position and momentum is extremely limited. The observations made by EPR and Heisenberg illustrate two extreme cases of the interplay between entanglement and uncertainty. On the one hand, no entanglement means that measurements will be maximally uncertain. Yet on the other hand, maximal entanglement means that there is no more uncertainty at all. Here we show that this apparent rift can be reconciled in that it is indeed possible to have an exact relation - an equality - between the amount of uncertainty and the amount of entanglement.},

In particular, we prove the possibility to perform privacy amplification and classical data compression with quantum side information modeled by a von Neumann algebra. From this we generalize the formula of Renes and Renner characterizing the optimal length of a distillable secure finite-key.

@article{bertawilde14,
  abstract      = {The conditional quantum mutual information {\$}I(A;B|C){\$} of a tripartite state {\$}\backslashrho{\_}{\{}ABC{\}}{\$} is an information quantity which lies at the center of many problems in quantum information theory. Three of its main properties are that it is non-negative for any tripartite state, that it decreases under local operations applied to systems {\$}A{\$} and {\$}B{\$}, and that it obeys the duality relation {\$}I(A;B|C) = I(A;B|D){\$} for a four-party pure state on systems {\$}ABCD{\$}. The conditional mutual information also underlies the squashed entanglement, an entanglement measure that satisfies all of the axioms desired for an entanglement measure. As such, it has been an open question to find Renyi generalizations of the conditional mutual information, that would allow for a deeper understanding of the original quantity and find applications beyond the traditional memoryless setting of quantum information theory. The present paper addresses this question, by defining different {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-Renyi generalizations {\$}I{\_}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}(A;B|C){\$} of the conditional mutual information that all converge to the conditional mutual information in the limit {\$}\backslashalpha \backslashto 1{\$}. Furthermore, we prove that many of these generalizations satisfy the aforementioned properties. As such, the quantities defined here should find applications in quantum information theory and perhaps even in other areas of physics, but we leave this for future work. Finally, we state a conjecture regarding the monotonicity of the Renyi conditional mutual informations defined here with respect to the Renyi parameter {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}. We prove that this conjecture is true in some special cases and provide evidence that it is true when {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} is in a neighborhood of one.},

  abstract      = {The entropic uncertainty relation with quantum side information (EUR-QSI) from [Berta et al., Nat. Phys. 6, 659 (2010)] is a unifying principle relating two distinctive features of quantum mechanics: quantum uncertainty due to measurement incompatibility, and entanglement. In these relations, quantum uncertainty takes the form of preparation uncertainty where one of two incompatible measurements is applied. In particular, the "uncertainty witness" lower bound in the EUR-QSI is not a function of a post-measurement state. An insightful proof of the EUR-QSI from [Coles et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 210405 (2012)] makes use of a fundamental mathematical consequence of the postulates of quantum mechanics known as the non-increase of quantum relative entropy under quantum channels. Here, we exploit this perspective to establish a tightening of the EUR-QSI which adds a new state-dependent term in the lower bound, related to how well one can reverse the action of a quantum measurement. As such, this new term is a direct function of the post-measurement state and can be thought of as quantifying how much disturbance a given measurement causes. Our result thus quantitatively unifies this feature of quantum mechanics with the others mentioned above.},

Furthermore, we show how the accuracy of any strategy relates to its accuracy in its classical usage, which is well understood for the important examples. We show the usefulness of our framework by using it to obtain new and simple security proofs for the following quantum-cryptographic schemes: quantum oblivious-transfer from bit-commitment, and BB84 quantum-key-distribution.},

@article{wehner13,
  abstract      = {The second law of thermodynamics tells us which state transformations are so statistically unlikely that they are effectively forbidden. Its original formulation, due to Clausius, states that "Heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other change, connected therewith, occurring at the same time". The second law applies to systems composed of many particles interacting; however, we are seeing that one can make sense of thermodynamics in the regime where we only have a small number of particles interacting with a heat bath. Is there a second law of thermodynamics in this regime? Here, we find that for processes which are cyclic or very close to cyclic, the second law for microscopic systems takes on a very di?erent form than it does at the macroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on what state transformations are possible, but an entire family of constraints. In particular, we find a family of free energies which generalise the traditional one, and show that they can never increase. We further find that there are three regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state transitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can cause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of embezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its original state. These second laws are not only relevant for small systems, but also apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range interactions, which only satisfy the ordinary second law on average. By making precise the definition of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics take on a simple form with the first law defining the class of thermal operations, the zeroeth law emerging as a unique condition ensuring the theory is nontrivial, and the remaining laws being a monotonicity property of our generalised free energies.},

@article{brandao11,
  abstract      = {Squashed entanglement is a measure for the entanglement of bipartite quantum states. In this paper we present a lower bound for squashed entanglement in terms of a distance to the set of separable states. This implies that squashed entanglement is faithful, that is, it is strictly positive if and only if the state is entangled. We derive the lower bound on squashed entanglement from a lower bound on the quantum conditional mutual information which is used to define squashed entanglement. The quantum conditional mutual information corresponds to the amount by which strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropy fails to be saturated. Our result therefore sheds light on the structure of states that almost satisfy strong subadditivity with equality. The proof is based on two recent results from quantum information theory: the operational interpretation of the quantum mutual information as the optimal rate for state redistribution and the interpretation of the regularised relative entropy of entanglement as an error exponent in hypothesis testing. The result has two applications in complexity theory. The first application is a quasipolynomial-time algorithm solving the weak membership problem for the set of separable states in LOCC or Euclidean norm. The second application concerns quantum Merlin- Arthur games. Here we show that multiple provers are not more powerful than a single prover when the verifier is restricted to LOCC operations thereby providing a new characterisation of the complexity class QMA.},

It is also an upper bound for the measured relative entropy distance of the state to its reconstructed version.

The corresponding capacity is often referred to as the one-shot quantum capacity. In this paper, we prove bounds on the one-shot quantum capacity of an arbitrary channel. This allows us to compute the quantum capacity of a channel with arbitrarily correlated noise, in the limit of asymptotically many uses of the channel. In the memoryless case, we explicitly show that our results reduce to known expressions for the quantum capacity.},

We provide finite-key unconditional security bounds for two practical implementations of the Bennett–Brassard 1984 coding: prepare-and-measure implementations without decoy states and entanglement-based implementations. A finite-key bound for prepare-and-measure implementations with decoy states is also derived under a simplified treatment of the statistical fluctuations. The presentation is tailored to allow direct application of the bounds in experiments. Finally, the bounds are also evaluated on a priori reasonable expected values of the observed parameters.},

  abstract      = {Particle motion at the micro-scale is an incessant tug-of-war between thermal fluctuations and applied forces on one side, and the strong resistance exerted by fluid viscosity on the other. Friction is so strong that completely neglecting inertia - the overdamped approximation - gives an excellent effective description of the actual particle mechanics. In sharp contrast with this result, here we show that the overdamped approximation dramatically fails when thermodynamic quantities such as the entropy production in the environment is considered, in presence of temperature gradients. In the limit of vanishingly small, yet finite inertia, we find that the entropy production is dominated by a contribution that is anomalous, i.e. has no counterpart in the overdamped approximation. This phenomenon, that we call entropic anomaly, is due to a symmetry-breaking that occurs when moving to the small, finite inertia limit. Strong production of anomalous entropy is traced back to intense sweeps down the temperature gradient.},

  abstract      = {Given a random quantum state of multiple (distinguishable or indistinguishable) particles, we provide an algorithm, rooted in symplectic geometry, to compute the joint probability distribution of the eigenvalues of its one-body reduced density matrices, and hence some associated physical invariants of the state. As a corollary, by taking the support of this probability distribution, which is a convex polytope, we recover a complete solution to the one-body quantum marginal problem, i.e., the problem of characterizing the one-body reduced density matrices that arise from some multi-particle quantum state. In the fermionic instance of the problem, which is known as the one-body N-representability problem, the famous Pauli principle amounts to one linear inequality in the description of the convex polytope. We obtain the probability distribution by reducing to computing the corresponding distribution of diagonal entries (i.e., to the quantitative version of a classical marginal problem), which is then determined algorithmically. This reduction applies more generally to symplectic geometry, relating invariant measures for a compact Lie group action to that for the maximal torus action; we state and prove our results in this more general symplectic setting. Our approach is in striking contrast to the existing solution to the computation of the supporting polytope by Klyachko and by Berenstein and Sjamaar, which made crucial use of non-Abelian features. In algebraic geometry, Duistermaat-Heckman measures correspond to the asymptotic distribution of multiplicities of irreducible representations in the associated coordinate ring. In the case of the one-body quantum marginal problem, these multiplicities include bounded height Kronecker and plethysm coefficients. A quantized version of the Abelianization procedure provides an efficient algorithm for their computation.},

  abstract      = {We propose a general method for studying properties of quantum channels acting on an n-partite system, whose action is invariant under permutations of the subsystems. Our main result is that, in order to prove that a certain property holds for an arbitrary input, it is sufficient to consider the case where the input is a particular de Finetti-type state, i.e., a state which consists of n identical and independent copies of an (unknown) state on a single subsystem. Our technique can be applied to the analysis of information-theoretic problems. For example, in quantum cryptography, we get a simple proof for the fact that security of a discrete-variable quantum key distribution protocol against collective attacks implies security of the protocol against the most general attacks. The resulting security bounds are tighter than previously known bounds obtained with help of the exponential de Finetti theorem.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we present a new entanglement monotone for bipartite quantum states. Its definition is inspired by the so-called intrinsic information of classical cryptography and is given by the halved minimum quantum conditional mutual information over all tripartite state extensions. We derive certain properties of the new measure which we call "squashed entanglement": it is a lower bound on entanglement of formation and an upper bound on distillable entanglement. Furthermore, it is convex, additive on tensor products, and superadditive in general. Continuity in the state is the only property of our entanglement measure which we cannot provide a proof for. We present some evidence, however, that our quantity has this property, the strongest indication being a conjectured Fannes type inequality for the conditional von Neumann entropy. This inequality is proved in the classical case.},

  abstract      = {Randomness is an important resource for many applications, from gambling to secure communication. However, guaranteeing that the output from a candidate random source could not have been predicted by an outside party is a challenging task, and many supposedly random sources used today provide no such guarantee. Quantum solutions to this problem exist, for example a device which internally sends a photon through a beam-splitter and observes on which side it emerges, but, presently, such solutions require the user to trust the internal workings of the device. Here we seek to go beyond this limitation by asking whether randomness can be generated using untrusted devices|even ones created by an adversarial agent|while providing a guarantee that no outside party (including the agent) can predict it. Since this is easily seen to be impossible unless the user has an initially private random string, the task we investigate here is private randomness expansion. We introduce a protocol for private randomness expansion with untrusted devices which is designed to take as input an initially private random string and produce as output a longer private random string. We point out that private randomness expansion protocols are generally vulnerable to attacks that can render the initial string partially insecure, even though that string is used only inside a secure laboratory; our protocol is designed to remove this previously unconsidered vulnerability by privacy amplification. We also discuss extensions of our protocol designed to generate an arbitrarily long random string from a finite initially private random string. The security of these protocols against the most general attacks is left as an open question.},

Some hierarchical orderings of these measures have been established, e.g., discord is bigger than entanglement, and we present a class of bipartite states, called premeasurement states, for which several of these hierarchies collapse to a single value. Because premeasurement states are the kind of states produced when a system interacts with a measurement device, the hierarchy collapse implies that the uncertainty of an observable is quantitatively connected to the quantum correlations (entanglement, discord, etc.) produced when that observable is measured. This fascinating connection between uncertainty and quantum correlations leads to a reinterpretation of entropic formulations of the uncertainty principle, so-called entropic uncertainty relations, including ones that allow for quantum memory. These relations can be thought of as lower-bounds on the entanglement created when incompatible observables are measured. Hence, we find that entanglement creation exhibits complementarity, a concept that should encourage exploration into "entanglement complementarity relations".},

  abstract      = {We use a Holevo measure to study quantum information in a tripartite quantum system, including the case in which part {\$}a{\$} is the input, and {\$}b{\$} and {\$}c{\$} the outputs of a quantum channel and its complementary channel. Specifically, we consider how the presence in {\$}b{\$} of a particular type of information associated with an orthonormal basis {\$}w{\$} of {\$}a{\$} is linked to or constrains the presence in {\$}c{\$} of a different type of information about {\$}a{\$}. Our first main result: For a pure tripartite state the difference between the {\$}w{\$} type of information contained in {\$}b{\$} and {\$}c{\$} is independent of {\$}w{\$}. The second: a general inequality, also applying to POVMs, extending the idea that if the {\$}w{\$} type of information is perfectly present in {\$}b{\$}, a mutually-unbiased type {\$}u{\$} must be absent from {\$}c{\$}. The extension provides quantitative bounds when the {\$}w{\$} information is not perfectly present, and the {\$}u{\$} is not perfectly mutually unbiased. We also generalize other all-or-nothing theorems. As applied to complementary channels {\$}\backslashEC{\$} and {\$}\backslashFC{\$}, these results imply that if two mutually-unbiased types are transmitted well by {\$}\backslashEC{\$}, or a single type well by {\$}\backslashEC{\$} and poorly by {\$}\backslashFC{\$}, then {\$}\backslashEC{\$} is close to ideal and {\$}\backslashFC{\$} carries very little information. We also study measures of the Holevo kind in which von Neumann is replaced by some other variety of entropy: quadratic (or ``linear''), Renyi, and Tsallis. However, our strongest results require strong subadditivity, which is only true in general for the von Neumann entropy.},

@article{cooney14,
  abstract      = {This paper studies the difficulty of discriminating between an arbitrary quantum channel and a "replacer" channel that discards its input and replaces it with a fixed state. The results obtained here generalize those known in the theory of quantum hypothesis testing for binary state discrimination. We show that, in this particular setting, the most general adaptive discrimination strategies provide no asymptotic advantage over non-adaptive tensor-power strategies. This conclusion follows by proving a quantum Stein's lemma for this channel discrimination setting, showing that a constant bound on the Type I error leads to the Type II error decreasing to zero exponentially quickly at a rate determined by the maximum relative entropy registered between the channels. The strong converse part of the lemma states that any attempt to make the Type II error decay to zero at a rate faster than the channel relative entropy implies that the Type I error necessarily converges to one. We then refine this latter result by identifying the optimal strong converse exponent for this task. As a consequence of these results, we can establish a strong converse theorem for the quantum-feedback-assisted capacity of a channel, sharpening a result due to Bowen. Furthermore, our channel discrimination result demonstrates the asymptotic optimality of a non-adaptive tensor-power strategy in the setting of quantum illumination, as was used in prior work on the topic. The sandwiched R$\backslash$'enyi relative entropy is a key tool in our analysis.},

This property represents a step towards ruling out certain alternative models for the explanation of quantum correlations such as hidden communication at finite speed. Whereas it is not possible to rule out this model experimentally, it is the goal of our approach to demonstrate this explanation to be logically inconsistent: either the communication cannot remain hidden, or its speed has to be infinite. The existence of a three-party system that is pairwise nonlocal is of independent interest in the light of the monogamy property of nonlocality.},

We call protocols achieving such certified amplification of a short random seed randomness amplifiers. We introduce a simple framework in which we initiate the systematic study of the possibilities and limitations of randomness amplifiers. Our main results include a new, improved analysis of a robust randomness amplifier with exponential expansion, as well as the first upper bounds on the maximum expansion achievable by a broad class of randomness amplifiers. In particular, we show that non-adaptive randomness amplifiers that are robust to noise cannot achieve more than doubly exponential expansion. Finally, we show that a wide class of protocols based on the use of the CHSH game can only lead to (singly) exponential expansion if adversarial devices are allowed the full power of non-signaling strategies. Our upper bound results apply to all known non-adaptive randomness amplifier constructions to date.},

However, when quantum effects are involved, we do not know how to compute channel capacities. The capacity to transmit quantum information is essential to quantum cryptography and computing, but the formula involves maximising the coherent information over arbitrarily many channel uses. This is because entanglement across channel uses can increase the coherent information, even from zero to non-zero! However, in all known examples, at least to detect whether the capacity is non-zero, two channel uses already suffice. Maybe a finite number of channel uses is always sufficient? Here, we show this is emphatically not the case: for any n, there are channels for which the coherent information is zero for n uses, but which nonetheless have capacity.

As such, determining the structure of these channels is a pressing open question in quantum information theory. We give a comprehensive review of what is currently known about the structure of degradable quantum channels, including a number of new results as well as alternate proofs of some known results. In the case of qubits, we provide a complete characterization of all degradable channels with two dimensional output, give a new proof that a qubit channel with two Kraus operators is either degradable or anti-degradable and present a complete description of anti-degradable unital qubit channels with a new proof. For higher output dimensions we explore the relationship between the output and environment dimensions ({\$}d{\_}B{\$} and {\$}d{\_}E{\$} respectively) of degradable channels. For several broad classes of channels we show that they can be modeled with a environment that is "small" in the sense {\$}d{\_}E \backslashleq d{\_}B{\$}. Perhaps surprisingly, we also present examples of degradable channels with ``large'' environments, in the sense that the minimal dimension {\$}d{\_}E > d{\_}B{\$}. Indeed, one can have {\$}d{\_}E > \backslashtfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}4{\}} d{\_}B{\^{}}2{\$}. In the case of channels with diagonal Kraus operators, we describe the subclass which are complements of entanglement breaking channels.

@article{curty09,
  abstract      = {The use of decoy states in quantum key distribution (QKD) has provided a method for substantially increasing the secret key rate and distance that can be covered by QKD protocols with practical signals. The security analysis of these schemes, however, leaves open the possibility that the development of better proof techniques, or better classical post-processing methods, might further improve their performance in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the secure key rate for decoy state QKD. These bounds are based basically only on the classical correlations established by the legitimate users during the quantum communication phase of the protocol. The only assumption about the possible post-processing methods is that double click events are randomly assigned to single click events. Further we consider only secure key rates based on the uncalibrated device scenario which assigns imperfections such as detection inefficiency to the eavesdropper. Our analysis relies on two preconditions for secure two-way and one-way QKD: The legitimate users need to prove that there exists no separable state (in the case of two-way QKD), or that there exists no quantum state having a symmetric extension (one-way QKD), that is compatible with the available measurements results. Both criteria have been previously applied to evaluate single-photon implementations of QKD. Here we use them to investigate a realistic source of weak coherent pulses. The resulting upper bounds can be formulated as a convex optimization problem known as a semidefinite program which can be efficiently solved. For the standard four-state QKD protocol, they are quite close to known lower bounds, thus showing that there are clear limits to the further improvement of classical post-processing techniques in decoy state QKD.},

  abstract      = {Quantum key distribution promises unconditionally secure communications. However, as practical devices tend to deviate from their specifications, the security of some practical systems is no longer valid. In particular, an adversary can exploit imperfect detectors to learn a large part of the secret key, even though the security proof claims otherwise. Recently, a practical approach-measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution-has been proposed to solve this problem. However, so far its security has only been fully proven under the assumption that the legitimate users of the system have unlimited resources. Here we fill this gap and provide a rigorous security proof against general attacks in the finite-key regime. This is obtained by applying large deviation theory, specifically the Chernoff bound, to perform parameter estimation. For the first time we demonstrate the feasibility of long-distance implementations of measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution within a reasonable time frame of signal transmission.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, lower bounds on error probability in coding for discrete classical and classical-quantum channels are studied. The contribution of the paper goes in two main directions: i) extending classical bounds of Shannon, Gallager and Berlekamp to classical-quantum channels, and ii) proposing a new framework for lower bounding the probability of error of channels with a zero-error capacity in the low rate region. The relation between these two problems is revealed by showing that Lov$\backslash$'asz' bound on zero-error capacity emerges as a natural consequence of the sphere packing bound once we move to the more general context of classical-quantum channels. A variation of Lov$\backslash$'asz' bound is then derived to lower bound the probability of error in the low rate region by means of auxiliary channels. As a result of this study, connections between the Lov$\backslash$'asz theta function, the expurgated bound of Gallager, the cutoff rate of a classical channel and the sphere packing bound for classical-quantum channels are established.},

It depends on a parameter {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} and acts as a parent quantity for other relative entropies which have important operational significances in quantum information theory: the quantum relative entropy and the min- and max-relative entropies. There is, however, another relative entropy, called the 0-relative Renyi entropy, which plays a key role in the analysis of various quantum information-processing tasks in the one-shot setting.

This, along with existing results in the literature, suggests that it suffices to consider two essential parent quantities from which operationally relevant entropic quantities can be derived - the quantum Renyi divergence with parameter {\$}\backslashalpha \backslashge 1/2{\$}, and the {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-relative R$\backslash$'enyi entropy with {\$}\backslashalpha\backslashin [0,1){\$}.},

In contrast, it is known that the product state capacity of a memoryless quantum channel satisfies the strong converse property. This result is retrieved from our one-shot bounds in the asymptotic limit. The expression for the strong converse rate of an arbitrary sequence of classical-quantum channels, which was originally derived by Hayashi and Nagaoka, can also be obtained from our one-shot results.

  abstract      = {We provide a framework for one-shot quantum rate distortion coding, in which the goal is to determine the minimum number of qubits required to compress quantum information as a function of the probability that the distortion incurred upon decompression exceeds some specified level. We first derive lower and upper bounds on the minimum qubit compression size of a one-shot entanglement-assisted quantum rate distortion code. These bounds then lead to a one-shot characterization of the minimum qubit compression size for an entanglement-assisted quantum rate-distortion code in terms of the smooth max-information, a quantity previously employed in the one-shot quantum reverse Shannon theorem. Next, we show how these bounds converge to the known expression for the entanglement-assisted quantum rate distortion function for asymptotically many copies of a memoryless quantum information source. Finally, we give a tight, finite blocklength characterization for the entanglement-assisted minimum qubit compression size of a memoryless isotropic qubit source subject to an average symbol-wise distortion constraint.},

In this work, we investigate the second-order asymptotics of the entanglement-assisted communication task. That is, we consider how quickly the rates of entanglement-assisted codes converge to the entanglement-assisted capacity of a channel as a function of the number of channel uses and the error tolerance. We define a quantum generalization of the mutual information variance of a channel in the entanglement-assisted setting. For covariant channels, we show that this quantity is equal to the channel dispersion, and characterizes the convergence towards the entanglement-assisted capacity when the number of channel uses increases. More generally, we prove that the Gaussian approximation of the second-order coding rate is achievable for all quantum channels.},

@article{delrio11,
  abstract      = {The heat generated by computations is not only an obstacle to circuit miniaturization but also a fundamental aspect of the relationship between information theory and thermodynamics. In principle, reversible operations may be performed at no energy cost; given that irreversible computations can always be decomposed into reversible operations followed by the erasure of data, the problem of calculating their energy cost is reduced to the study of erasure. Landauer's principle states that the erasure of data stored in a system has an inherent work cost and therefore dissipates heat. However, this consideration assumes that the information about the system to be erased is classical, and does not extend to the general case where an observer may have quantum information about the system to be erased, for instance by means of a quantum memory entangled with the system. Here we show that the standard formulation and implications of Landauer's principle are no longer valid in the presence of quantum information. Our main result is that the work cost of erasure is determined by the entropy of the system, conditioned on the quantum information an observer has about it. In other words, the more an observer knows about the system, the less it costs to erase it. This result gives a direct thermodynamic significance to conditional entropies, originally introduced in information theory. Furthermore, it provides new bounds on the heat generation of computations: because conditional entropies can become negative in the quantum case, an observer who is strongly correlated with a system may gain work while erasing it, thereby cooling the environment.},

This is shown to be equal to the capacity of the channel for generating a secret key, and neither capacity is enhanced by forward public classical communication. Motivated by the work of Schumacher and Westmoreland on quantum privacy and quantum coherence, parallels between private classical information and quantum information are exploited to obtain an expression for the capacity of a quantum channel for generating pure bipartite entanglement. The latter implies a new proof of the quantum channel coding theorem and a simple proof of the converse. The coherent information plays a role in all of the above mentioned capacities},

Specifically, given an arbitrary quantum state of three systems, where Alice holds two and Bob holds one, we identify the cost, in terms of quantum communication and entanglement, for Alice to give one of her parts to Bob. The communication cost gives the first known operational interpretation to quantum conditional mutual information. The optimal procedure is self-dual under time reversal and is perfectly composable.

We point out and correct a flaw in one of the paper's main arguments. Our alternative argument highlights the role played by transpositions induced by the random gates in achieving convergence.},

While a wide range of problems can be solved this way, one of the most basic coding problems remains impervious to a direct application of this method: sending classical information through a quantum channel. We will show that this problem can, in fact, be solved using decoupling ideas, specifically by proving a "dequantizing" theorem, which ensures that the environment is only classically correlated with the sent data. Our techniques naturally yield a generalization of the Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem to the one-shot scenario, where a quantum channel can be applied only once.},

  abstract      = {If a quantum system A, which is initially correlated to another system, E, undergoes an evolution separated from E, then the correlation to E generally decreases. Here, we study the conditions under which the correlation disappears completely, resulting in a decoupling of A from E. We give a criterion for decoupling in terms of two smooth entropies, one quantifying the amount of initial correlation between A and E, and the other characterizing the mapping that describes the evolution of A. The criterion applies to arbitrary such mappings and is tight if the mapping satisfies certain natural conditions. Decoupling has a number of applications both in physics and information theory, e.g., as a building block for quantum information processing protocols. As an example, we give a one-shot state merging protocol and show that it is essentially optimal in terms of its entanglement consumption/production.},

We find that in order to observe EPR entanglement the total optical loss must be smaller than 33.3 {\%}. However, arbitrary strong EPR entanglement is generally possible with this scheme. We realize continuous wave squeezed light at 1550 nm with up to 9.9 dB of non-classical noise reduction, which is the highest value at a telecom wavelength so far. Using two phase controlled balanced homodyne detectors we observe an EPR co-variance product of 0.502 $\backslash$pm 0.006 < 1, where 1 is the critical value.

  abstract      = {Quantum key distribution performs the trick of growing a secret key in two distant places connected by a quantum channel. The main reason is that the legitimate users can bound the information gathered by the eavesdropper. In practical systems, whether because of finite resources or external conditions, the quantum channel is subject to fluctuations. A rate adaptive information reconciliation protocol, that adapts to the changes in the communication channel, is then required to minimize the leakage of information in the classical postprocessing. We consider here the leakage of a rate-adaptive information reconciliation protocol. The length of the exchanged messages is larger than that of an optimal protocol; however, we prove that the min-entropy reduction is limited. The simulation results, both on the asymptotic and in the finite-length regime, show that this protocol allows to increase the amount of distillable secret key.},

  abstract      = {The nonlocal behavior of quantum mechanics enables to generate guaranteed fresh randomness from an untrusted device that consists of two nonsignalling components. Since the generation process requires some initial fresh randomness to act as a catalyst, one also speaks of randomness expansion. Previous works showed the freshness of the generated randomness only for an adversary that holds no quantum side information, or, equivalently, has measured all quantum side information before the randomness is generated by the device. Thus, until now it was unclear if and how much fresh randomness can be generated by an untrusted device in the presence of an adversary that maintains a quantum state.   In this work, we show that security against quantum side information comes "for free". Specifically, we show that with the same procedure, the very same amount of randomness can be generated in the presence of quantum side information as can be generated without any (quantum or classical) side information.   Our result on the freshness of the generated randomness against an adversary that is permitted to maintain an arbitrary quantum state, not only provides security in a stronger and more realistic setting, but also implies composability. For instance, the randomness generated from one device can be used as initial randomness for another - possibly entangled - device, and the resulting generated randomness from this second device can then again be used as initial randomness for the first device, and so on.   As an application of the composability, we obtain the first randomness-expansion scheme from untrusted devices that offers exponential expansion; previous schemes merely achieved polynomial expansion.},

While the state can, and usually does, extend across all space, it is only defined at one instant of time, in conflict with special relativity where space and time are treated on an equal footing. Here we ask what would happen if we defined the notion of the quantum density matrix for multiple spatial and temporal measurements. We introduce the concept of a pseudo-density matrix which treats space and time indiscriminately. This matrix in general fails to be positive for timelike separated measurements, motivating us to define a measure of causality that discriminates between spacelike and timelike correlations. Important properties of this measure, such as monotonicity under local operations, are proved. Two qubit NMR experiments are presented that illustrate how a temporal pseudo-density matrix approaches a genuinely allowed density matrix as the amount of decoherence is increased between two consecutive measurements.},

  abstract      = {Uncertainty relations are a distinctive characteristic of quantum theory that impose intrinsic limitations on the precision with which physical properties can be simultaneously determined. The modern work on uncertainty relations employs *entropic measures* to quantify the lack of knowledge associated with measuring non-commuting observables. However, there is no fundamental reason for using entropies as quantifiers; any functional relation that characterizes the uncertainty of the measurement outcomes defines an uncertainty relation. Starting from a very reasonable assumption of invariance under mere relabelling of the measurement outcomes, we show that Schur-concave functions are the most general uncertainty quantifiers. We then discover a novel fine-grained uncertainty relation that is given in terms of the majorization order between two probability vectors. Such a vector-type uncertainty relation generates an infinite family of distinct scalar uncertainty relations via the application of arbitrary uncertainty quantifiers. Our relation is therefore universal and captures the essence of uncertainty in quantum theory.},

  abstract      = {Bell's Theorem witnesses that the predictions of quantum theory cannot be reproduced by theories of local hidden variables in which observers have free will. In this context, free will means that the agents conducting measurements can choose between different measurement settings in each run of the experiment, and this choice is random and independent of the source. Here we show how to replace the need for having different measurement settings for each party by the introduction of several independent sources. Working out an idea of Branciard, Rosset, Gisin and Pironio, we obtain new versions of Bell's Theorem which discard those local hidden variable theories in which the sources are independent. Since each party has only one measurement setting in these scenarios, there is no choice required and the consideration of free will becomes obsolete. This adds conceptual clarity to Bell's Theorem and eliminates the philosophical burden associated to the concept of free will. Moreover, it is more general than the standard framework: we describe examples of quantum nonlocality which were previously unspeakable.},

  abstract      = {This paper, mostly expository in nature, surveys four measures of distinguishability for quantum-mechanical states. This is done from the point of view of the cryptographer with a particular eye on applications in quantum cryptography. Each of the measures considered is rooted in an analogous classical measure of distinguishability for probability distributions: namely, the probability of an identification error, the Kolmogorov distance, the Bhattacharyya coefficient, and the Shannon (1948) distinguishability (as defined through mutual information). These measures have a long history of use in statistical pattern recognition and classical cryptography. We obtain several inequalities that relate the quantum distinguishability measures to each other, one of which may be crucial for proving the security of quantum cryptographic key distribution. In another vein, these measures and their connecting inequalities are used to define a single notion of cryptographic exponential indistinguishability for two families of quantum states. This is a tool that may prove useful in the analysis of various quantum-cryptographic protocols},

As an application we extend characterizing properties of the min- and max-entropy, as well as operational aspects. We show that the interpretation of min-entropy as maximum achievable quantum correlation, and max-entropy as decoupling accuracy, still hold in infinite dimensions. We furthermore generalize the smoothed versions of these entropies, and prove an infinite-dimensional version of the quantum asymptotic equipartition property.

This enlargement sometimes exposes the implemented protocol to new kinds of attacks that have not yet been analyzed.   We consider several quantum key distribution implementations that use interferometers, and analyze the enlargement of the quantum space caused by the interferometers. While we prove that some interferometric implementations are robust (against simple attacks), we also show that several other implementations used in QKD experiments are totally insecure.   This result is somewhat surprising since although we assume ideal devices and an underlying protocol which is proven secure (e.g., the Bennett-Brassard QKD), the realization is insecure. Our novel attack demonstrates the risks of using practical realizations without performing an extensive security analysis regarding the specific setup in use.},

The number of assumptions has been continuously reduced, from requiring the validity of quantum mechanics in early QKD, to more general constraints on the laws of physics in device-independent QKD. Despite steady theoretical progress in dealing with known limitations of current technology, in practice the security of QKD relies not only on the quantum protocol but on the physical implementation. A variety of attacks have been conceived to exploit weaknesses of current systems. Here we demonstrate the first full field implementation of an eavesdropper attacking an established QKD connection. The eavesdropper obtains the complete 'secret' key, while none of the results measured by the legitimate parties indicate a breach in security. This confirms that non-idealities in physical implementations of QKD can be fully exploitable.},

  abstract      = {In device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD), the violation of a Bell inequality is exploited to establish a shared key that is secure independently of the internal workings of the QKD devices. An experimental implementation of DIQKD, however, is still awaited, since hitherto all optical Bell tests are subject to the detection loophole, making the protocol unsecured. In particular, photon losses in the quantum channel represent a fundamental limitation for DIQKD. Here, we introduce a heralded qubit amplifier based on single-photon sources and linear optics that provides a realistic solution to overcome the problem of channel losses in Bell tests.},

Our proof applies when both the source and the detector have small basis-dependent flaws, as is typical in practical implementations of the protocol. We derive a general lower bound on the asymptotic key generation rate for weakly basis-dependent eavesdropping attacks, and also estimate the rate in some special cases: sources that emit weak coherent states with random phases, detectors with basis-dependent efficiency, and misaligned sources and detectors.},

The first uncertainty relation bounds the sum of two mutual informations when one party measures a single observable and the other party measures one of two observables. The uncertainty relation does not follow from Maassen-Uffink uncertainty relation and is much stronger than Hall uncertainty relation derived from the latter. The second uncertainty relation bounds the sum of two mutual informations when each party measures one of two observables. We provide numerical evidence for validity of conjectured uncertainty relations and prove them for large classes of states and observables.},

We show that these infinite-dimensional optimization problems can all be reduced to optimization problems over small finite dimensional spaces which are tractable. Our results lead to a comprehensive and unified treatment of the problem of obtaining sharp inequalities between {\$}f{\$}-divergences. We demonstrate that many of the existing results on inequalities between {\$}f{\$}-divergences can be obtained as special cases of our results and we also improve on some existing non-sharp inequalities.},

  abstract      = {The fully quantum reverse Shannon theorem establishes the optimal rate of noiseless classical communication required for simulating the action of many instances of a noisy quantum channel on an arbitrary input state, while also allowing for an arbitrary amount of shared entanglement of an arbitrary form. Turning this theorem around establishes a strong converse for the entanglement-assisted classical capacity of any quantum channel. This paper proves the strong converse for entanglement-assisted capacity by a completely different approach. Namely, we exploit the recent entanglement-assisted "meta-converse" theorem of Matthews and Wehner, several properties of the recently established sandwiched Renyi relative entropy (also referred to as the quantum Renyi divergence), and the multiplicativity of completely bounded {\$}p{\$}-norms due to Devetak et al. The proof here demonstrates the extent to which the Arimoto approach can be helpful in proving strong converse theorems, it provides an operational relevance for the multiplicativity result of Devetak et al., and it adds to the growing body of evidence that the sandwiched Renyi relative entropy is the correct quantum generalization of the classical concept for all {\$}\backslashalpha > 1{\$}.},

Polar coding gives the first known explicit construction with rigorous proofs of all these properties.   We give an elementary proof of the capacity achieving property of polar codes that does not rely on the martingale convergence theorem. As a result, we are able to explicitly show that polar codes can have block length (and consequently also encoding and decoding complexity) that is bounded by a polynomial in the gap to capacity. The generator matrix of such polar codes can be constructed in polynomial time using merging of channel output symbols to reduce the alphabet size of the channels seen at the decoder.},

  abstract      = {The usual formulation of quantum theory is based on rather obscure axioms (employing complex Hilbert spaces, Hermitean operators, and the trace rule for calculating probabilities). In this paper it is shown that quantum theory can be derived from five very reasonable axioms. The first four of these are obviously consistent with both quantum theory and classical probability theory. Axiom 5 (which requires that there exists continuous reversible transformations between pure states) rules out classical probability theory. If Axiom 5 (or even just the word "continuous" from Axiom 5) is dropped then we obtain classical probability theory instead. This work provides some insight into the reasons quantum theory is the way it is. For example, it explains the need for complex numbers and where the trace formula comes from. We also gain insight into the relationship between quantum theory and classical probability theory.},

However, this requires exponential time. We show that random circuits of only polynomial length will approximate the first and second moments of the Haar distribution, thus forming approximate 1- and 2-designs. Previous constructions required longer circuits and worked only for specific gate sets. As a corollary of our main result, we also improve previous bounds on the convergence rate of random walks on the Clifford group.},

The degree of the security has not been discussed in the finite coding-length framework, sufficiently. However, to guarantee any implemented QKD system required, it is needed to evaluate a protocol with a finite coding length. For this purpose, we derive a tight upper bound of the eavesdropper’s information. This bound is better than existing bounds. We also obtain the exponential rate of the eavesdropper’s information. Further, we approximate our bound by using the normal distribution.},

SMC replaces the random bits by other meaningful secret messages, and a collection of secret messages serves as the random bits to hide the rest of messages. In the previous researches, multiple secret messages were assumed to have independent and uniform distributions, which is difficult to be ensured in practice. We remove this restrictive assumption by a generalization of the channel resolvability technique. We also give practical construction techniques for SMC by using an arbitrary given error-correcting code as an ingredient, and channel-universal coding of SMC. By using the same principle as the channel-universal SMC, we give coding for the broadcast channel with confidential messages universal to both channel and source distributions.},

Specifically, we consider the effect of applying a hash function on a source and we quantify the level of non-uniformity and dependence of the compressed source from another correlated source when the number of copies of the sources is large. Unlike previous works that use Shannon information measures to quantify randomness, information or uniformity, in this paper, we define our security measures in terms of a more general class of information measures---the R$\backslash$'enyi information measures and their Gallager-type counterparts. A special case of these R$\backslash$'enyi information measure is the class of Shannon information measures. We prove tight asymptotic results for the security measures and their exponential rates of decay. We also prove bounds on the second-order asymptotics and show that these bounds match when the magnitudes of the second-order coding rates are large. We do so by establishing new classes non-asymptotic bounds on the equivocation and evaluating these bounds using various probabilistic limit theorems asymptotically.},

Here, we show that the Renyi mutual information attains operational meaning in the context of composite hypothesis testing, when the null hypothesis is a fixed bipartite state and the alternate hypothesis consists of all product states that share one marginal with the null hypothesis. This hypothesis testing problem occurs naturally in channel coding, where it corresponds to testing whether a state is the output of a given quantum channel or of a 'useless' channel whose output is decoupled from the environment. Similarly, we establish an operational interpretation of Renyi conditional entropy by choosing an alternative hypothesis that consists of product states that are maximally mixed on one system. Specialized to classical probability distributions, our results also establish an operational interpretation of Renyi mutual information and Renyi conditional entropy.},

We also show that (non-)disturbance is in general not a symmetric relation and that it can be decided and quantified by means of a semidefinite program.},

  abstract      = {Quantum f-divergences are a quantum generalization of the classical notion of f-divergences, and are a special case of Petz' quasi-entropies. Many well known distinguishability measures of quantum states are given by, or derived from, f-divergences; special examples include the quantum relative entropy, the Renyi relative entropies, and the Chernoff and Hoeffding measures. Here we show that the quantum f-divergences are monotonic under the dual of Schwarz maps whenever the defining function is operator convex. This extends and unifies all previously known monotonicity results. We also analyze the case where the monotonicity inequality holds with equality, and extend Petz' reversibility theorem for a large class of f-divergences and other distinguishability measures. We apply our findings to the problem of quantum error correction, and show that if a stochastic map preserves the pairwise distinguishability on a set of states, as measured by a suitable f-divergence, then its action can be reversed on that set by another stochastic map that can be constructed from the original one in a canonical way. We also provide an integral representation for operator convex functions on the positive half-line, which is the main ingredient in extending previously known results on the monotonicity inequality and the case of equality. The presentation is completely self-contained and requires only standard knowledge of matrix analysis.},

Let such a game be given and assume that the maximum probability that Alice and Bob can win is v<1. Raz (SIAM J.

In this work, we simplify Raz's proof in various ways and thus shorten it significantly. Further we study the case where Alice and Bob are not restricted to local computations and can use any strategy which does not imply communication among them.},

@article{horodecki10,
  abstract      = {The discovery of quantum key distribution by Bennett and Brassard (BB84) bases on the fundamental quantum feature: incompatibility of measurements of quantum non-commuting observables. In 1991 Ekert showed that cryptographic key can be generated at a distance with help of entangled (correlated) quantum particles. Recently Barrett, Hardy and Kent showed that the non-locality used by Ekert is itself a good resource of cryptographic key even beyond quantum mechanics. Their result paved the way to new generation of quantum cryptographic protocols - secure even if the devices are built by the very eavesdropper. However, there is a question, which is fundamental from both practical and philosophical point of view: does Nature offer security on operational level based on the original concept behind quantum cryptography - that information gain about one observable must cause disturbance to another, incompatible one? Here we resolve this problem by using another striking feature of quantum world - contextuality. It is a strong version of incompatibility manifested in the famous Kochen-Specker paradox. The crucial concept is the use of a new class of families of bipartite probability distributions . We show that if two persons share systems which locally exhibit the Kochen-Specker paradox and, in addition, exhibit perfect correlations, then they can extract secure key, even if they do not trust the quantum devices. This is the first operational protocol that directly implements the fundamental feature of Nature: the information gain vs. disturbance trade-off. For sake of proof we exhibit a new Bell's inequality which is interesting in itself. The security is proved not by exploiting strong violation of the inequality by quantum mechanics (as one usually proceeds), but rather by arguing, that quantum mechanics cannot violate it too much.},

  abstract      = {This paper studies the class of stochastic maps, or channels, for which (I⊗$\Phi$)($\Gamma$) is always separable (even for entangled $\Gamma$). Such maps are called entanglement breaking, and can always be written in the form $\Phi$($\rho$)=∑kRkTrFk$\rho$ where each Rk is a density matrix and Fk>0. If, in addition, $\Phi$ is trace-preserving, the {\{}Fk{\}} must form a positive operator valued measure (POVM). Some special classes of these maps are considered and other characterizations given. Since the set of entanglement-breaking trace-preserving maps is convex, it can be characterized by its extreme points. The only extreme points of the set of completely positive trace preserving maps which are also entanglement breaking are those known as classical-quantum or CQ. However, for d≥3, the set of entanglement breaking maps has additional extreme points which are not extreme CQ maps.},

  abstract      = {Information--be it classical or quantum--is measured by the amount of communication needed to convey it. In the classical case, if the receiver has some prior information about the messages being conveyed, less communication is needed. Here we explore the concept of prior quantum information: given an unknown quantum state distributed over two systems, we determine how much quantum communication is needed to transfer the full state to one system. This communication measures the partial information one system needs, conditioned on its prior information. We find that it is given by the conditional entropy--a quantity that was known previously, but lacked an operational meaning. In the classical case, partial information must always be positive, but we find that in the quantum world this physical quantity can be negative. If the partial information is positive, its sender needs to communicate this number of quantum bits to the receiver; if it is negative, then sender and receiver instead gain the corresponding potential for future quantum communication. We introduce a protocol that we term 'quantum state merging' which optimally transfers partial information. We show how it enables a systematic understanding of quantum network theory, and discuss several important applications including distributed compression, noiseless coding with side information, multiple access channels and assisted entanglement distillation.},

  abstract      = {Deriving rigorous bounds for the time scales that are needed for thermalization forms one of the most vexing problems when it comes to understanding statistical mechanics from the principles of quantum mechanics. One central aspect in obtaining such bounds is to determine how long a system retains memory of its initial conditions. By viewing this problem from an quantum information theory perspective, we are able to simplify part of this task in a very natural and easy way. We first show that for any interaction between the system and the environment, and almost all initial states of the system, the question of how long such memory lasts can be answered by studying the temporal evolution of just one special initial state. This special state thereby depends only on our knowledge of macroscopic parameters of the system. We provide a simple entropic inequality for this state that can be used to determine whether mosts states of the system have, or have not become independent of their initial conditions after time t. Analyzing the rate of entropy change over time for a particular kind of interaction then allows us to place rigorous bounds on such time scales. We make a similar statement for almost all initial states of the environment, and finally provide a sufficient condition for which a system never thermalizes, but remains close to its initial state for all times.},

Our main result is the first nontrivial lower bound on the class MIP* of languages having multi-prover interactive proofs with entangled provers; namely MIP* contains NEXP, the class of languages decidable in non-deterministic exponential time. While Babai, Fortnow, and Lund (Computational Complexity 1991) proved the celebrated equality MIP = NEXP in the absence of entanglement, ever since the introduction of the class MIP* it was open whether shared entanglement between the provers could weaken or strengthen the computational power of multi-prover interactive proofs. Our result shows that it does not weaken their computational power: MIP* contains MIP. At the heart of our result is a proof that Babai, Fortnow, and Lund's multilinearity test is sound even in the presence of entanglement between the provers, and our analysis of this test could be of independent interest. As a byproduct we show that the correlations produced by any entangled strategy which succeeds in the multilinearity test with high probability can always be closely approximated using shared randomness alone.},

  abstract      = {Two interferometric complementarities are formulated and demonstrated, and relations between them are analyzed. The first relates the distinguishability D(scrP) of the path of propagation of a particle (where scrP is the preparation of an ensemble) to the fringe visibility v1 when amplitudes from two paths are combined. It is shown that [maxD(scrP)]2+v12=1, where the maximum is taken over all preparations compatible with a fixed density operator. The second complementarity relates the visibility of one-particle interference fringes to the visibility v12 of two-particle fringes: v122+v12≤1. With a suitable extension of operations on the pair of particles, this inequality is strengthened to an equality.},

@article{kaniewski13,
  abstract      = {We investigate two-party cryptographic protocols that are secure under assumptions motivated by physics, namely relativistic assumptions (no-signalling) and quantum mechanics. In particular, we discuss the security of bit commitment in so-called split models, i.e. models in which at least some of the parties are not allowed to communicate during certain phases of the protocol. We find the minimal splits that are necessary to evade the Mayers-Lo-Chau no-go argument and present protocols that achieve security in these split models. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of local versus global command, a subtle issue that arises when the split committer is required to delegate non-communicating agents to open the commitment. We argue that classical protocols are insecure under global command in the split model we consider. On the other hand, we provide a rigorous security proof in the global command model for Kent's quantum protocol [Kent 2011, Unconditionally Secure Bit Commitment by Transmitting Measurement Outcomes]. The proof employs two fundamental principles of modern physics, the no-signalling property of relativity and the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics.},

  abstract      = {We consider one-round games between a classical referee and two players. One of the main questions in this area is the parallel repetition question: Is there a way to decrease the maximum winning probability of a game without increasing the number of rounds or the number of players? Classically, efforts to resolve this question, open for many years, have culminated in Raz's celebrated parallel repetition theorem on one hand, and in efficient product testers for PCPs on the other. In the case where players share entanglement, the only previously known results are for special cases of games, and are based on techniques that seem inherently limited. Here we show for the first time that the maximum success probability of entangled games can be reduced through parallel repetition, provided it was not initially 1. Our proof is inspired by a seminal result of Feige and Kilian in the context of classical two-prover one-round interactive proofs. One of the main components in our proof is an orthogonalization lemma for operators, which might be of independent interest.},

  abstract      = {We propose a new unconditionally secure bit commitment scheme based on Minkowski causality and the properties of quantum information. The receiving party sends a number of randomly chosen BB84 qubits to the committer at a given point in space-time. The committer carries out measurements in one of the two BB84 bases, depending on the committed bit value, and transmits the outcomes securely at light speed in opposite directions to remote agents. These agents unveil the bit by returning the outcomes to adjacent agents of the receiver. The security proofs rely only on simple properties of quantum information and the impossibility of superluminal signalling.},

  abstract      = {The fundamental properties of quantum information and its applications to computing and cryptography have been greatly illuminated by considering information-theoretic tasks that are provably possible or impossible within non-relativistic quantum mechanics. I describe here a general framework for defining tasks within (special) relativistic quantum theory and illustrate it with examples from relativistic quantum cryptography and relativistic distributed quantum computation. The framework gives a unified description of all tasks previously considered and also defines a large class of new questions about the properties of quantum information in relation to Minkowski causality. It offers a way of exploring interesting new fundamental tasks and applications, and also highlights the scope for a more systematic understanding of the fundamental information-theoretic properties of relativistic quantum theory.},

We define simple security models for this task and briefly discuss alternatives. We illustrate the pitfalls of naive quantum cryptographic reasoning in this context by describing several protocols which at first sight appear unconditionally secure but which, as we show, can in fact be broken by teleportation-based attacks. We also describe some protocols which cannot be broken by these specific attacks, but do not prove they are unconditionally secure. We review the history of quantum tagging protocols, which we first discussed in 2002 and described in a 2006 patent (for an insecure protocol). The possibility has recently been reconsidered by other authors. All the more recently discussed protocols of which we are aware were either previously considered by us in 2002-3 or are variants of schemes then considered, and all are provably insecure.},

  abstract      = {We show that almost all known lower bound methods for communication complexity are also lower bounds for the information complexity. In particular, we define a relaxed version of the partition bound of Jain and Klauck and prove that it lower bounds the information complexity of any function. Our relaxed partition bound subsumes all norm based methods (e.g. the factorization norm method) and rectangle-based methods (e.g. the rectangle/corruption bound, the smooth rectangle bound, and the discrepancy bound), except the partition bound. Our result uses a new connection between rectangles and zero-communication protocols where the players can either output a value or abort. We prove the following compression lemma: given a protocol for a function f with information complexity I, one can construct a zero-communication protocol that has non-abort probability at least 2{\^{}}{\{}-O(I){\}} and that computes f correctly with high probability conditioned on not aborting. Then, we show how such a zero-communication protocol relates to the relaxed partition bound. We use our main theorem to resolve three of the open questions raised by Braverman. First, we show that the information complexity of the Vector in Subspace Problem is {\{}$\backslash$Omega{\}}(n{\^{}}{\{}1/3{\}}), which, in turn, implies that there exists an exponential separation between quantum communication complexity and classical information complexity. Moreover, we provide an {\{}$\backslash$Omega{\}}(n) lower bound on the information complexity of the Gap Hamming Distance Problem.},

Then, we apply those results to approximate conversion problems of entangled pure states in quantum systems when only local operations and classical communiactions (LOCC) are allowed. Our results can be regarded as a generalization of those for the resolvability and the intrinsic randomness, and the quantum application of our results can be regarded as a generalization of those for the entanglement dilution and concentration. Moreover, we will introduce the notion of LOCC cloning for a known pure entangled state and derive its optimal asymptotic performance. To derive the optimal second-order rates, the majorization method is used, which is a basic tool in the conversion theory of quantum entangled pure states by LOCC. In this paper, we show the efficiency of the majorization method not only in quantum settings but also in classical settings.},

Then, except with (exponentially in r) small probability, the min-entropy of the sample is not smaller than, roughly, a fraction r/n of the total min-entropy of all positions X{\_}1, ..., X{\_}n, which is optimal. Here, we show that this statement, originally proven by Vadhan [LNCS, vol. 2729, Springer, 2003] for the purely classical case, is still true if the min-entropy is measured relative to a quantum system. Because min-entropy quantifies the amount of randomness that can be extracted from a given random variable, our result can be used to prove the soundness of locally computable extractors in a context where side information might be quantum-mechanical. In particular, it implies that key agreement in the bounded-storage model (using a standard sample-and-hash protocol) is fully secure against quantum adversaries, thus solving a long-standing open problem.},

Such a statement was previously only known for classical channels and the quantum identity channel. By relating the problem to the additivity of minimum output entropies, we show that a strong converse holds for a large class of channels, including all unital qubit channels, the d-dimensional depolarizing channel and the Werner-Holevo channel. This further justifies the interpretation of the classical capacity as a sharp threshold for information-transmission.},

This is well known as the direct part and strong converse of quantum Stein's lemma. Here we look into the behavior of this sudden change and have make it clear how the error of first kind grows according to a lower order of the error exponent of the second kind, and hence, we obtain the second order asymptotics for quantum hypothesis testing. Our method is elementary, based on basic linear algebra and probability theory. It deals with the achievability part and the converse part in a unified framework, with a clear geometric picture.},

@article{Liang2012,
  abstract      = {A well-known manifestation of quantum entanglement is that it may lead to correlations that are inexplicable within the framework of a locally causal theory --- a fact that is demonstrated by the quantum violation of Bell inequalities. The precise relationship between quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell inequalities is, however, not well understood. While it is known that entanglement is necessary for such a violation, it is not clear whether all entangled states violate a Bell inequality, even in the scenario where one allows joint operations on multiple copies of the state and local filtering operations before the Bell experiment. In this paper we show that all entangled states, namely, all non-fully-separable states of arbitrary Hilbert space dimension and arbitrary number of parties, violate a Bell inequality when combined with another state which on its own cannot violate the same Bell inequality. This result shows that quantum entanglement and quantum nonlocality are in some sense equivalent, thus giving an affirmative answer to the aforementioned open question. It follows from our result that two entangled states that are apparently useless in demonstrating quantum nonlocality via a specific Bell inequality can be combined to give a Bell violation of the same inequality. Explicit examples of such activation phenomenon are provided.},

However, in reality, quantum channels are lossy, and this can be exploited for attacks based on the detection loophole. Here, we propose a novel approach to DIQKD that overcomes this limitation. In particular, based on a combination between an entropic uncertainty relation and the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) test, we design a DIQKD protocol where the CHSH test is carried out entirely in Alice's laboratory. Thus the loophole caused by channel losses is avoided.},

We also show that certain operationally relevant families of R$\backslash$'enyi divergences are differentiable at {\$}\backslashalpha = 1{\$}. Finally, our analysis reveals that the derivative at {\$}\backslashalpha = 1{\$} evaluates to half the relative entropy variance, a quantity that has attained operational significance in second-order quantum hypothesis testing.},

In the 4-party case, there is only one such inequality, the so-called Ingleton inequality. For these systems we show that strong subadditivity, weak monotonicity and Ingleton inequality exactly characterize the entropy cone for stabiliser states.},

Its violation can be used to secure a shared secret between two parties, but a fair-sampling assumption has to be made for limited detection efficiencies. Here, we present an experimental violation of a Bell inequality by classical states, exploiting imperfections in common photodetectors. We also propose measurements to obtain violations exceeding those allowed by quantum physics for ideal Bell tests.

We then show that such a refined dataanalysis guarantees the security of our scheme against the most general eavesdroppingstrategy, thus generalizing Shor and Preskill’s proof of security of BB84 to ournew scheme. Until now, most proposed proofs of security of single-particle type quantum key distribution schemes have relied heavily upon the fact that the bases arechosen uniformly, randomly, and independently.

Here, we propose a simple solution to this problem—measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (QKD). It not only removes all detector side channels, but also doubles the secure distance with conventional lasers. Our proposal can be implemented with standard optical components with low detection efficiency and highly lossy channels. In contrast to the previous solution of full device independent QKD, the realization of our idea does not require detectors of near unity detection efficiency in combination with a qubit amplifier (based on teleportation) or a quantum nondemolition measurement of the number of photons in a pulse. Furthermore, its key generation rate is many orders of magnitude higher than that based on full device independent QKD. The results show that long-distance quantum cryptography over say 200 km will remain secure even with seriously flawed detectors.},

@article{shields09,
  abstract      = {Quantum cryptography, and especially quantum key distribution (QKD), is steadily progressing to become a viable tool for cryptographic services. In recent years we have witnessed a dramatic increase in the secure bit rate of QKD, as well as its extension to ever longer fibre- and air-based links and the emergence of metro-scale trusted networks. In the foreseeable future even global-scale communications may be possible using quantum repeaters or Earth–satellite links. A handful of start-ups and some bigger companies are already active in the field. The launch of an initiative to form industrial standards for QKD, under the auspices of the European Telecommunication Standards Institute, described in the paper by Laenger and Lenhart in this Focus Issue, can be taken as a sign of the growing commercial interest. Recent progress has seen an increase in the secure bit rate of QKD links, by orders of magnitude, to over 1 Mb s −1 . This has resulted mainly from an improvement in the detection technology. Here changes in the way conventional semiconductor detectors are gated, as well as the development of novel devices based on non-linear processes and superconducting materials, are leading the way. Additional challenges for QKD at GHz clock rates include the design of high speed electronics, remote synchronization and high rate random number generation. Substantial effort is being devoted to increasing the range of individual links, which is limited by attenuation and other losses in optical fibres and air links. An important advance in the past few years has been the introduction of protocols with the same scaling as an ideal single-photon set-up. The good news is that these schemes use standard optical devices, such as weak laser pulses. Thanks to these new protocols and improvements in the detection technology, the range of a single fibre link can exceed a few hundred km. Outstanding issues include proving the unconditional security of some of the schemes. Much of the work done to date relates to point-to-point links. Another recent advance has been the development of trusted networks for QKD. This is important for further increasing the range of the technology, and for overcoming denial-of-service attacks on an individual link. It is interesting to see that the optimization of QKD devices differs for point-to-point and network applications. Network operation is essential for widespread adoption of the technology, as it can dramatically reduce the deployment costs and allow connection flexibility. Also important is the multiplexing of the quantum signals with conventional network traffic. For the future, quantum repeaters should be developed for longer range links. On the theoretical side, different approaches to security proofs have recently started to converge, offering several paradigms of the same basic idea. Our improved theoretical understanding places more stringent demands on the QKD devices. We are aware by now that finite size effects in key generation arise not only from parameter estimation. It will not be possible to generate a key from just a few hundred received signals. It is a stimulating challenge for the theory of security proofs to develop lean proof strategies that work with finite signal block sizes. As QKD advances to a real-world cryptographic solution, side channel attacks must be carefully analysed. Theoretical security proofs for QKD schemes are so far based on physical models of these devices. It is in the nature of models that any real implementation will deviate from this model, creating a potential weakness for an eavesdropper to exploit. There are two solutions to this problem: the traditional path of refining the models to reduce the deviations, or the radically different approach of device-independent security proofs, in which none or only a few well controlled assumptions about the devices are made. Clearly, it is desirable to find security proofs that require only minimal or fairly general model descriptions and are based on observable tests during the run of QKD sessions. It is now 25 years since the first proposal for QKD was published and 20 since the first experimental realization. The intervening years have brought several technological and theoretical advances, which have driven new insights into the application of quantum theory to the wider field of information technology. We are looking forward to the new twists and turns this field will take in the next 25 years!

We show a generic method to improve resulting secure key rates by partially reversing the simplifying post-processing for error correction purposes. We apply our method to the security analysis of device-independent QKD schemes and of detection-device-independent QKD schemes, where in both cases one is typically required to assign binary values even to lost signals. In the device-independent case, the loss tolerance threshold is cut down by our method from 92.4{\%} to 90.9{\%}.The lowest tolerable transmittance of the detector-device-independent scheme can be improved from 78.0{\%} to 65.9{\%}.},

  abstract      = {Recently it has been shown how the use of quantum entanglement can lead to the creation of real-time communication channels whose viability can be made location dependent. Such functionality leads to new security paradigms that are not possible in classical communication networks. Key to these new security paradigms are quantum protocols that can unconditionally determine that a receiver is in fact at an a priori assigned location. A limiting factor of such quantum protocols will be the decoherence of states held in quantum memory. Here we investigate the performance of quantum location verification protocols under decoherence effects. More specifically, we address the issue of how decoherence impacts the verification using N = 2 qubits entangled as Bell states, as compared to N > 2 qubits entangled as GHZ states. We study the original quantum location verification protocol, as well as a variant protocol, introduced here, which utilizes teleportation. We find that the performance of quantum location verification is in fact similar for Bell states and some N > 2 GHZ states, even though quantum decoherence degrades larger-qubit entanglements faster. Our results are important for the design and implementation of location-dependent communications in emerging quantum networks.},

In this work we show how unconditional location verification can be achieved with the use of quantum communication channels. Our verification remains unconditional irrespective of the number of receivers, computational capacity, or any other physical resource held by an adversary. Quantum location verification represents a new application of quantum entanglement that delivers a feat not possible in the classical-only channel.

As a consequence of this we find new schemes sharing classical secrets for arbitrary access structures. We then clarify the relationship to quantum error correction and observe several restrictions thereby imposed, which for example indicates that for pure state threshold schemes the share size {\$}q{\$} must scale with the number of players {\$}n{\$} as {\$}q\backslashgeq \backslashsqrt{\{}n{\}}{\$}.},

This strong form of security is possible only when using correlations that violate a Bell inequality. Here, we provide a general security proof for a large class of protocols in a model in which the raw key is generated by independent measurements. This independence condition may be justifiable in several implementations and is necessarily satisfied when the raw key is generated by N separate pairs of devices.

Analysing the optimal performance of these codes yields an alternative proof of the finite block length converse of Polyanskiy, Poor and Verd$\backslash$'u, and shows that they achieve this converse. This provides an explicit formulation of the converse as a linear program which has some useful features.

The comparison of the results to the well-known post-selection technique for the BB84 and six-state protocol shows the high relevance of this method.

The main advantage of the obtained upper bound is that it can be formulated as a semidefinite program, which can be efficiently solved. We illustrate our results by analysing two well-known qubit-based QKD protocols: the four-state protocol and the six-state protocol. Recent results by Renner et al., Phys. Rev.

Together with related results for the direct part of quantum hypothesis testing, known as the quantum Hoeffding bound, our result suggests that the operationally relevant definition of the quantum Renyi relative entropies depends on the parameter $\backslash$alpha: for $\backslash$alpha<1, the right choice seems to be the traditional definition, whereas for $\backslash$alpha>1 the right choice is the newly introduced version. As a sideresult, we show that the new Renyi $\backslash$alpha-relative entropies are asymptotically attainable by measurements for $\backslash$alpha>1, and give a new simple proof for their monotonicity under completely positive trace-preserving maps.},

@article{muller09,
  abstract      = {If we combine two secure cryptographic systems, is the resulting system still secure? Answering this question is highly nontrivial and has recently sparked a considerable research effort, in particular, in the area of classical cryptography. A central insight was that the answer to the question is yes, but only within a well-specified composability framework and for carefully chosen security definitions. In this article, we review several aspects of composability in the context of quantum cryptography. The first part is devoted to key distribution. We discuss the security criteria that a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol must fulfill to allow its safe use within a larger security application (e.g. for secure message transmission); and we demonstrate—by an explicit example—what can go wrong if conventional (non-composable) security definitions are used. Finally, to illustrate the practical use of composability, we show how to generate a continuous key stream by sequentially composing rounds of a QKD protocol. In the second part, we take a more general point of view, which is necessary for the study of cryptographic situations involving, for example, mutually distrustful parties. We explain the universal composability (UC) framework and state the composition theorem that guarantees that secure protocols can securely be composed to larger applications. We focus on the secure composition of quantum protocols into unconditionally secure classical protocols. However, the resulting security definition is so strict that some tasks become impossible without additional security assumptions. Quantum bit commitment is impossible in the UC framework even with mere computational security. Similar problems arise in the quantum bounded storage model and we observe a trade-off between the UC and the use of the weakest possible security assumptions.},

Of particular interest are thereby relations in terms of the smooth min-entropy for BB84 and six-state encodings. Previously, strong uncertainty relations were obtained which are valid in the limit of large block lengths. Here, we prove a new uncertainty relation in terms of the smooth min-entropy that is only marginally less strong, but has the crucial property that it can be applied to rather small block lengths. This paves the way for a practical implementation of many cryptographic protocols. As part of our proof we show tight uncertainty relations for a family of Renyi entropies that may be of independent interest.},

We experimentally executed this protocol by performing measurements on polarization-entangled photon pairs. Our work includes a full security analysis, accounting for all experimental error rates and finite size effects. This demonstrates the feasibility of two-party protocols in this model using real-world quantum devices.

Our approach differs from previous ones in two points: First, it supports a reasoning inspired by the method of types. Second, the measurement scheme we propose to distinguish the two alternatives not only does that job asymptotically perfect, but also yields additional information about the null hypothesis. An example of that is given. The measurement is composed of projections onto permutation-invariant subspaces, thus providing a direct link between one of the most basic tasks in quantum information on the one hand side and fundamental objects in representation theory on the other. We additionally connect to representation theory by proving a relation between Kostka numbers and quantum states, and to state estimation via a generalization of a well-known spectral estimation theorem to non-i.i.d. sequences.},

We prove as the main result that such a process generates the average entanglement of the uniform (unitarily invariant) measure in at most O(N3) steps for N qubits. This is despite an exponentially growing number of such gates being necessary for generating that measure fully on the state space. Numerics furthermore show a variation cutoff allowing one to associate a specific time with the achievement of the uniform measure entanglement distribution. Various extensions of this work are discussed. The results are relevant to entanglement theory and to protocols that assume generic entanglement can be achieved efficiently.},

We show that they are inextricably and quantitatively linked: Quantum mechanics cannot be more nonlocal with measurements that respect the uncertainty principle. In fact, the link between uncertainty and nonlocality holds for all physical theories. More specifically, the degree of nonlocality of any theory is determined by two factors: the strength of the uncertainty principle and the strength of a property called “steering,” which determines which states can be prepared at one location given a measurement at another.},

  abstract      = {Uncertainty relations capture the essence of the inevitable randomness associated with the outcomes of two incompatible quantum measurements. Recently, Berta et al. have shown that the lower bound on the uncertainties of the measurement outcomes depends on the correlations between the observed system and an observer who possesses a quantum memory. If the system is maximally entangled with its memory, the outcomes of two incompatible measurements made on the system can be predicted precisely. Here, we obtain a new uncertainty relation that tightens the lower bound of Berta et al., by incorporating an additional term that depends on the quantum discord and the classical correlations of the joint state of the observed system and the quantum memory. We discuss several examples of states for which our new lower bound is tighter than the bound of Berta et al. On the application side, we discuss the relevance of our new inequality for the security of quantum key distribution and show that it can be used to provide bounds on the distillable common randomness and the entanglement of formation of bipartite quantum states.},

A conjecture about the scalar curvature of a Fisher information geometry is explained. The described subjects are overviewed in details in the matrix setting, but at the very end the von Neumann algebra approach is sketched shortly.},

  abstract      = {It has been suggested that nature could be discrete in the sense that the underlying state space of a physical system has only a finite number of pure states. For example, the Bloch ball of a single qubit could be discretized into small patches and only appear round to us due to experimental limitations. Here, we present a strong physical argument for the quantum theoretical property that every state space (even the smallest possible one, the qubit) has infinitely many pure states. We propose a simple physical postulate which dictates that in fact the only possible discrete theory is classical mechanics. More specifically, we postulate that no information gain implies no disturbance, or read in the contrapositive, that disturbance leads to some form of information gain. In a theory like quantum mechanics where we already know that the converse holds, i.e. information gain does imply disturbance, this can be understood as postulating an equivalence between disturbance and information gain. What is more, we show that non-classical discrete theories are still ruled out even if we relax the postulate to hold only approximately in the sense that no information gain only causes a small amount of disturbance. Finally, our postulate also rules out popular generalizations such as the PR-box that allows non-local correlations beyond the limits of quantum theory.},

For the case of AWGN channel the author shows that Berlekamp's (1980) tangential bound can be improved, but even this improved bound does not coincide with the random coding bound, although it can be very close to it},

The minimization problem is numerically tractable, and we find good agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations for spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet in two dimensions.

  abstract      = {Number-phase uncertainty relations are formulated in terms of unified entropies which form a family of two-parametric extensions of the Shannon entropy. For two generalized measurements, unified-entropy uncertainty relations are given in both the state-dependent and state-independent forms. A few examples are discussed as well. Using the Pegg--Barnett formalism and the Riesz theorem, we obtain a nontrivial inequality between norm-like functionals of generated probability distributions in finite dimensions. The principal point is that we take the infinite-dimensional limit right for this inequality. Hence number-phase uncertainty relations with finite phase resolutions are expressed in terms of the unified entropies. Especially important case of multiphoton coherent states is separately considered. We also give some entropic bounds in which the corresponding integrals of probability density functions are involved.},

  abstract      = {Quantum computation and cryptography both involve scenarios in which a user interacts with an imperfectly modelled or 'untrusted' system. It is therefore of fundamental and practical interest to devise tests that reveal whether the system is behaving as instructed. In 1969, Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt proposed an experimental test that can be passed by a quantum-mechanical system but not by a system restricted to classical physics. Here we extend this test to enable the characterization of a large quantum system. We describe a scheme that can be used to determine the initial state and to classically command the system to evolve according to desired dynamics. The bipartite system is treated as two black boxes, with no assumptions about their inner workings except that they obey quantum physics. The scheme works even if the system is explicitly designed to undermine it; any misbehaviour is detected. Among its applications, our scheme makes it possible to test whether a claimed quantum computer is truly quantum. It also advances towards a goal of quantum cryptography: namely, the use of 'untrusted' devices to establish a shared random key, with security based on the validity of quantum physics.},

Private states embody this effect, as they are precisely those multipartite quantum states from which two parties can produce a shared secret that cannot in any circumstance be correlated to an external system. Naturally, these play an important role in quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum information theory. However, a general distillation method has heretofore been missing. Inspired by Koashi's complementary control scenario (arXiv:0704.3661v1 [quant-ph]), we give a new definition of private states in terms of one party's potential knowledge of two complementary measurements made on the other and use this to construct a general method of private state distillation using quantum error-correcting codes. The procedure achieves the same key rate as recent, more information-theoretic approaches while demonstrating the physical principles underlying privacy of the key. Additionally, the same approach can be used to establish the hashing inequality for entanglement distillation, as well as the direct quantum coding theorem.},

Their analysis, however, often relies on the assumption that the subsystems are mutually independent (or only weakly correlated). Here, we show that this assumption is generally justified for quantum systems that are symmetric, that is, invariant under permutations of the subsystems. Because symmetry is often implied by natural properties, for example, the indistinguishability of identical particles, the result has a wide range of consequences. In particular, it implies that global properties of a large composite system can be estimated by measurements applied to a limited number of (randomly chosen) sample subsystems, a fact that is important for the interpretation of experimental data. Moreover, it generalizes statements in quantum information theory and cryptography, which previously have only been known to hold under certain independence assumptions.},

It is based on direct information-theoretic arguments and thus also applies if no equivalent entanglement purification scheme can be found. Using this technique, we investigate a general class of QKD protocols with one-way classical post-processing. We show that, in order to analyze the full security of these protocols, it suffices to consider collective attacks. Indeed, we give new lower and upper bounds on the secret-key rate which only involve entropies of two-qubit density operators and which are thus easy to compute. As an illustration of our results, we analyze the Bennett-Brassard 1984, the six-state, and the Bennett 1992 protocols with one-way error correction and privacy amplification. Surprisingly, the performance of these protocols is increased if one of the parties adds noise to the measurement data before the error correction. In particular, this additional noise makes the protocols more robust against noise in the quantum channel.},

  abstract      = {We use the entanglement sampling techniques developed by Dupuis, Fawzi and Wehner to find a lower bound on the entanglement needed by a coalition of cheater attacking the quantum position verification protocol using the four BB84 states in the scenario where the cheaters have no access to a quantum channel but share a (possibly mixed) entangled state {\$}\backslashtilde{\{}\backslashPhi{\}}{\$}. For a protocol using n qubits, a necessary condition for cheating is that the max- relative entropy of entanglement {\$}E{\_}{\{}\backslashmax{\}}(\backslashtilde{\{}\backslashPhi{\}})\backslashge n-O(\backslashlog n){\$}. This improves previously known best lower bound by a factor {\$}\backslashsim4{\$}, and it is essentially tight, since this protocol is vulnerable to a teleportation based attack using {\$}n-O(1){\$} ebits of entanglement.},

We also introduce the notion of a unitary code - a subset of U(d) in which the trace inner product of any pair of matrices is restricted to only a small number of distinct values - and give an upper bound for the size of a code of degree s in U(d) for any d and s. These bounds can be strengthened when the particular inner product values that occur in the code or design are known. Finally, we describe some constructions of designs: we give an upper bound on the size of the smallest weighted unitary t-design in U(d), and we catalogue some t-designs that arise from finite groups.},

We improve the recent bounds by Coles and Piani, which are known to be stronger than the well known result of Maassen and Uffink. Furthermore, we find a novel bound based on majorization techniques, which also happens to be stronger than the recent results involving largest singular values of submatrices of the unitary matrix connecting both bases. The first set of new bounds give better results for unitary matrices close to the Fourier matrix, while the second one provides a significant improvement in the opposite sectors. Some results derived admit generalization to arbitrary mixed states, so that corresponding bounds are increased by the von Neumann entropy of the measured state. The majorization approach is finally extended to the case of several measurements.},

The history of practical QKD demonstrates how misleading such a stance may be. An assessment of the latest developments shows that no threat seems unredeemable (in principle, QKD can be made secure) but that any specific implementation will always include some elements of trust. This leads us to guess that the field is going to split in two directions: those who pursue really practical devices may have to moderate their security claims; those who pursue ultimate security may have to suspend their claims of usefulness.},

For single-qubit implementations of such protocols, we find that the secret key rate becomes positive when at least N∼105 signals are exchanged and processed.

  abstract      = {Bell's theorem shows that local realistic theories place strong restrictions on observable correlations between different systems, giving rise to Bell's inequality which can be violated in experiments using entangled quantum states. Bell's theorem is based on the assumptions of realism, locality, and the freedom to choose between measurement settings. In experimental tests, "loopholes" arise which allow observed violations to still be explained by local realistic theories. Violating Bell's inequality while simultaneously closing all such loopholes is one of the most significant still open challenges in fundamental physics today. In this paper, we present an experiment that violates Bell's inequality while simultaneously closing the locality loophole and addressing the freedom-of-choice loophole, also closing the latter within a reasonable set of assumptions. We also explain that the locality and freedom-of-choice loopholes can be closed only within nondeterminism, i.e., in the context of stochastic local realism.},

@article{scholz08,
  abstract      = {The situation of two independent observers conducting measurements on a joint quantum system is usually modelled using a Hilbert space of tensor product form, each factor associated to one observer. Correspondingly, the operators describing the observables are then acting non-trivially only on one of the tensor factors. However, the same situation can also be modelled by just using one joint Hilbert space, and requiring that all operators associated to different observers commute, i.e. are jointly measurable without causing disturbance. The problem of Tsirelson is now to decide the question whether all quantum correlation functions between two independent observers derived from commuting observables can also be expressed using observables defined on a Hilbert space of tensor product form. Tsirelson showed already that the distinction is irrelevant in the case that the ambient Hilbert space is of finite dimension. We show here that the problem is equivalent to the question whether all quantum correlation functions can be approximated by correlation function derived from finite-dimensional systems. We also discuss some physical examples which fulfill this requirement.},

For classical information sent over classical or quantum channels, one could, under certain conditions, make a stronger statement that the reliability of the transmission shall decay exponentially to zero with the number of channel uses and the proof of this statement typically relies on a certain fundamental bound on the reliability of the transmission. Such a statement or the bound has never been given for sending quantum information. We give this bound and then use it to give the first example where the reliability of sending quantum information at rates above the capacity decays exponentially to zero.

This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.},

Ideally, the optimal key rate for a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol would be given by a single-letter formula involving optimization over a single use of an effective channel. We explore the possibility of such a formula for the simplest and most widely used QKD protocol, Bennnett-Brassard-84 with one-way classical postprocessing. We show that a conjectured single-letter formula is false, uncovering a deep ignorance about good private codes and exposing unfortunate complications in the theory of QKD. These complications are not without benefit—with added complexity comes better key rates than previously thought possible. The threshold for secure key generation improves from a bit error rate of 0.124 to 0.129.},

Our bound can be interpreted as the capacity of a channel for high-fidelity quantum communication when assisted by a family of channels that have no capacity on their own. This family of assistance channels, which we call symmetric side channels, consists of all channels mapping symmetrically to their output and environment. The bound seems to be quite tight, and for degradable quantum channels, it coincides with the unassisted channel capacity. Using this symmetric side channel capacity, we find new upper bounds on the capacity of the depolarizing channel. We also briefly indicate an analogous notion for distilling entanglement using the same class of (one-way) channels, yielding one of the few entanglement measures that is monotonic under local operations with one-way classical communication (1-LOCC), but not under the more general class of local operations with classical communication (LOCC).},

In some cases, even with a complete physical description of the system to be measured and the measurement apparatus, the outcomes of certain measurements are completely random. This raises the question, originating in the paper by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, of whether quantum mechanics is the optimal way to predict measurement outcomes. Established arguments and experimental tests exclude a few specific alternative models. Here, we provide a complete answer to the above question, refuting any alternative theory with significantly more predictive power than quantum theory. More precisely, we perform various measurements on distant entangled photons, and, under the assumption that these measurements are chosen freely, we give an upper bound on how well any alternative theory could predict their outcomes. In particular, in the case where quantum mechanics predicts two equally likely outcomes, our results are incompatible with any theory in which the probability of a prediction is increased by more than {\~{}}0.19. Hence, we can immediately refute any already considered or yet-to-be-proposed alternative model with more predictive power than this.},

While the proof is non-constructive, one may expect that the recovery is universal, in the sense that the same map {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}R{\}}{\_}{\{}B \backslashto BC{\}}{\$} works for all states with a given marginal {\$}\backslashrho{\_}{\{}BC{\}}{\$}. Here we show that this is indeed the case.},

  abstract      = {The quantum relative entropy between two states satisfies a monotonicity property meaning that applying the same quantum channel to both states can never increase their relative entropy. It is known that this inequality is only tight when there is a "recovery map" that exactly reverses the effects of the quantum channel on both states. In this paper we strengthen this inequality by showing that the difference of relative entropies is bounded below by the measured relative entropy between the first state and a recovered state from its processed version. The recovery map is a convex combination of rotated Petz recovery maps and perfectly reverses the quantum channel on the second state. As a special case we reproduce recent lower bounds on the conditional mutual information such as the one proved in [Fawzi and Renner, arXiv:1410.0664]. Our proof only relies on elementary properties of pinching maps and the operator logarithm.},

Because the reconstruction problem has many solutions in general, we consider the reconstructed state of maximal global entropy consistent with the local data. We show that unique ground states of local Hamiltonians are exactly reconstructed by taking the maximal entropy state. More generally, we show that if the state in question is a ground state of a local Hamiltonian with a degenerate subspace of locally indistinguishable ground states, then the maximal entropy state is close to the ground state projector. We show that perfect local reconstruction is also possible for thermal states of local Hamiltonians. Finally, we discuss a procedure to certify that the reconstructed state is close to the true global state. We call the entropy of our reconstructed maximum entropy state the "reconstruction entropy", and we discuss its relation to emergent geometry in the context of holographic duality.},

We are interested in conditions under which this evolution destroys all initial correlations between the subsystems A and R, i.e. decouples the subsystems. Quantitatively this is done in terms of decoupling theorems. Such theorems have proven useful in various applications in the area of quantum information theory. This paper builds on preceding work, which shows that decoupling can be achieved by applying a typical unitary on A chosen with respect to the Haar measure followed by a process that adds sufficient decoherence. Here, we prove a generalized decoupling theorem for the case where the unitary is chosen from an almost two-design. A main implication of this result is that decoupling is physical, in the sense that it can be achieved by short sequences of random two-body interactions, which can be modeled as efficient circuits. We discuss applications of this result.},

  abstract      = {This paper defines the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel as the maximum squashed entanglement that can be registered by a sender and receiver at the input and output of a quantum channel, respectively. A new subadditivity inequality for the original squashed entanglement measure of Christandl and Winter leads to the conclusion that the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel is an additive function of a tensor product of any two quantum channels. More importantly, this new subadditivity inequality, along with prior results of Christandl, Winter, et al., establishes the squashed entanglement of a quantum channel as an upper bound on the quantum communication capacity of any channel assisted by unlimited forward and backward classical communication. A similar proof establishes this quantity as an upper bound on the private capacity of a quantum channel assisted by unlimited forward and backward public classical communication. This latter result is relevant as a limitation on rates achievable in quantum key distribution. As an important application, we determine that these capacities can never exceed log((1+eta)/(1-eta)) for a pure-loss bosonic channel for which a fraction eta of the input photons make it to the output on average. The best known lower bound on these capacities is equal to log(1/(1-eta)). Thus, in the high-loss regime for which eta << 1, this new upper bound demonstrates that the protocols corresponding to the above lower bound are nearly optimal.},

While both entropies are equal to the von Neumann entropy in certain special cases (e.g., asymptotically, for many independent repetitions of the given data), their values can differ arbitrarily in the general case. In this work, a recently discovered duality relation between (non-smooth) min- and max-entropies is extended to the smooth case. More precisely, it is shown that the smooth min-entropy of a system A conditioned on a system B equals the negative of the smooth max-entropy of A conditioned on a purifying system C. This result immediately implies that certain operational quantities (such as the amount of compression and the amount of randomness that can be extracted from given data) are related.

Intuitively, by the monogamy of entanglement, the probability that both players simultaneously succeed in guessing the outcome correctly is bounded. We are interested in the question of how the success probability scales when this guessing game is repeated in parallel. We show a perfect parallel repetition theorem for this game, that is, we show that any strategy that maximizes the probability to win every round individually is also optimal for the parallel repetition of the game. In particular, our result implies that the optimal guessing probability can be achieved without the use of entanglement. We explore several applications of this result. First, we show that it implies security for standard BB84 quantum key distribution when one party uses fully untrusted measurement devices. Second, we show that our result can be used to prove security of a one-round position-verification scheme. Finally, our techniques can be used to generalize a well-known uncertainty relation for the guessing probability to quantum side information.},

  abstract      = {We consider two fundamental tasks in quantum information theory, data compression with quantum side information as well as randomness extraction against quantum side information. We characterize these tasks for general sources using so-called one-shot entropies. We show that these characterizations --- in contrast to earlier results --- enable us to derive tight second order asymptotics for these tasks in the i.i.d. limit. More generally, our derivation establishes a hierarchy of information quantities that can be used to investigate information theoretic tasks in the quantum domain: The one-shot entropies most accurately describe an operational quantity, yet they tend to be difficult to calculate for large systems. We show that they asymptotically agree up to logarithmic terms with entropies related to the quantum and classical information spectrum, which are easier to calculate in the i.i.d. limit. Our techniques also naturally yields bounds on operational quantities for finite block lengths.},

  abstract      = {Two of the most intriguing features of quantum physics are the uncertainty principle and the occurrence of nonlocal correlations. The uncertainty principle states that there exist pairs of incompatible measurements on quantum systems such that their outcomes cannot both be predicted. On the other hand, nonlocal correlations of measurement outcomes at different locations cannot be explained by classical physics, but appear in the presence of entanglement. Here, we show that these two fundamental quantum effects are quantitatively related. Namely, we provide an entropic uncertainty relation for the outcomes of two binary measurements, where the lower bound on the uncertainty is quantified in terms of the maximum Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt value that can be achieved with these measurements. We discuss applications of this uncertainty relation in quantum cryptography, in particular, to certify quantum sources using untrusted devices.},

  abstract      = {Despite enormous progress both in theoretical and experimental quantum cryptography, the security of most current implementations of quantum key distribution is still not established rigorously. One of the main problems is that the security of the final key is highly dependent on the number, M, of signals exchanged between the legitimate parties. While, in any practical implementation, M is limited by the available resources, existing security proofs are often only valid asymptotically for unrealistically large values of M. Here, we demonstrate that this gap between theory and practice can be overcome using a recently developed proof technique based on the uncertainty relation for smooth entropies. Specifically, we consider a family of Bennett-Brassard 1984 quantum key distribution protocols and show that security against general attacks can be guaranteed already for moderate values of M.},

While the established uncertainty relations apply to cases where the predictions are based on purely classical data (e.g., a description of the system's state before the measurement), an extended relation which remains valid in the presence of quantum information has been proposed recently [Berta et al., Nature Physics 6, 659 (2010)].

Since these entropy measures are related to operational quantities, our uncertainty relation has various applications.

Furthermore, we derive converse results for the oblivious transfer problem and the bit commitment problem by relating them to secret key agreement. Finally, we derive a necessary condition for the feasibility of secure computation by trusted parties that seek to compute a function of their collective data, using an interactive public communication that by itself does not give away the value of the function. In many cases, we strengthen and improve upon previously known converse bounds. Our results are single-shot and use only the given joint distribution of the correlated observations.

  abstract      = {The laws of quantum mechanics allow unconditionally secure key distribution protocols. Nevertheless, security proofs of traditional quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols rely on a crucial assumption, the trustworthiness of the quantum devices used in the protocol. In device-independent QKD, even this last assumption is relaxed: the devices used in the protocol may have been adversarially prepared, and there is no a priori guarantee that they perform according to specification. Proving security in this setting had been a central open problem in quantum cryptography. We give the first device-independent proof of security of a protocol for quantum key distribution that guarantees the extraction of a linear amount of key even when the devices are subject to a constant rate of noise. Our only assumptions are that the laboratories in which each party holds his or her own device are spatially isolated, and that both devices, as well as the eavesdropper, are bound by the laws of quantum mechanics. All previous proofs of security relied either on the use of many independent pairs of devices, or on the absence of noise.},

The system employs wavelength multiplexing in order to run over only a single optical fibre and is compactly integrated in 19-inch 2U racks. We optimized the system considering a security analysis that respects finite-key-size effects, authentication costs, and system errors. Using fast gated InGaAs single photon detectors, we reliably distribute secret keys with rates up to 140 kbps and over 25 km of optical fibre, for a security parameter of 4E-9.},

In this work, we establish improvements of this entropy inequality in the form of physically meaningful remainder terms. One of the main results can be summarized informally as follows: if the decrease in quantum relative entropy between two quantum states after a quantum physical evolution is relatively small, then it is possible to perform a recovery operation, such that one can perfectly recover one state while approximately recovering the other. This can be interpreted as quantifying how well one can reverse a quantum physical evolution. Our proof method is elementary, relying on the method of complex interpolation, basic linear algebra, and the recently introduced Renyi generalization of a relative entropy difference. The theorem has a number of applications in quantum information theory, which have to do with providing physically meaningful improvements to many known entropy inequalities.},

Here, we show that a fully collective strategy is not necessary in order to recover all of the information bits. In fact, when coding for a large number N uses of a cq channel W, N I(W{\_}acc) of the bits can be recovered by a non-collective strategy which amounts to coherent quantum processing of the results of product measurements, where I(W{\_}acc) is the accessible information of the channel W. In order to decode the other N (I(W) - I(W{\_}acc)) bits, where I(W) is the Holevo rate, our conclusion is that the receiver should employ collective measurements. We also present two other results: 1) collective Fuchs-Caves measurements (quantum likelihood ratio measurements) can be used at the receiver to achieve the Holevo rate and 2) we give an explicit form of the Helstrom measurements used in small-size polar codes. The main approach used to demonstrate these results is a quantum extension of Arikan's polar codes.},

Along with a corresponding achievability statement for rates below the capacity, such a strong converse theorem enhances our understanding of the capacity as a very sharp dividing line between possible and impossible rates of communication. Here, we show that such a strong converse theorem holds for the classical capacity of all entanglement-breaking channels and all Hadamard channels (the complementary channels of the former). These results follow by bounding the success probability in terms of a "sandwiched" Renyi relative entropy, by showing that this quantity is subadditive for all entanglement-breaking and Hadamard channels, and by relating this quantity to the Holevo capacity. Prior results regarding strong converse theorems for particular covariant channels emerge as a special case of our results.},

From these results we derive bounds on the efficiency of protocols that use different variants of OT as a black-box. When applied to implementations of OT, these bounds generalize most known results to the statistical case. Our results hold in particular for transformations between a finite number of primitives and for any error. In the second part we study the efficiency of quantum protocols implementing OT. While most classical lower bounds for perfectly secure reductions of OT to distributed randomness still hold in the quantum setting, we present a statistically secure protocol that violates these bounds by an arbitrarily large factor. We then prove a weaker lower bound that does hold in the statistical quantum setting and implies that even quantum protocols cannot extend OT. Finally, we present two lower bounds for reductions of OT to commitments and a protocol based on string commitments that is optimal with respect to both of these bounds.},

Until now, it has never been rigorously defined, so it has not been known (for example) what mixed states are steerable (that is, can be used to exhibit steering). We provide an operational definition, from which we prove (by considering Werner states and Isotropic states) that steerable states are a strict subset of the entangled states, and a strict superset of the states that can exhibit Bell-nonlocality. For arbitrary bipartite Gaussian states we derive a linear matrix inequality that decides the question of steerability via Gaussian measurements, and we relate this to the original EPR paradox.},

@article{wolf09,
  abstract      = {It is well known that jointly measurable observables cannot lead to a violation of any Bell inequality - independent of the state and the measurements chosen at the other site. In this letter we prove the converse: every pair of incompatible quantum observables enables the violation of a Bell inequality and therefore must remain incompatible within any other no-signaling theory. While in the case of von Neumann measurements it is sufficient to use the same pair of observables at both sites, general measurements can require different choices. The main result is obtained by showing that for arbitrary dimension the CHSH inequality provides the Lagrangian dual of the characterization of joint measurability. This leads to a simple criterion for joint measurability beyond the known qubit case.},

K$\backslash$"onig and Renner showed a min-entropy sampling theorem that holds relative to quantum knowledge. Their result achieves the optimal rate, but it can only be applied if the bits are sampled in block, and only gives weak bounds for non-smooth min-entropy. We give two new quantum min-entropy sampling theorems that do not have the above weaknesses. The first theorem shows that the result by K$\backslash$"onig and Renner also applies to bitwise sampling, and the second theorem gives a strong bound for the non-smooth min-entropy. Our results imply strong lower bounds for k-out-of-n random access codes. While previous results by Ben-Aroya, Regev, and de Wolf showed that the decoding probability is exponentially small in k if the storage rate is smaller than 0.7, our results imply that this holds for any storage rate strictly smaller than 1, which is optimal.},

  abstract      = {Signal amplification is ubiquitous in the control of physical systems, and the ultimate performance limit of amplifiers is set by quantum physics. Increasing the amplitude of an unknown quantum optical field, or any harmonic oscillator state, must introduce noise1. This linear amplification noise prevents perfect copying of the quantum state2, enforces quantum limits on communications and metrology3, and is the mechanism preventing the increase of entanglement via local operations. Non-deterministic versions of ideal cloning4 and local entanglement increase (distillation)5 are allowed, suggesting the possibility of non-deterministic noiseless linear amplification. Here we introduce, and experimentally demonstrate, such a noiseless linear amplifier for quantum states of the optical field, and use it for distillation of field-mode entanglement. This simple but powerful circuit enables practical devices for enhancing quantum technologies. The idea of noiseless amplification unifies approaches to cloning and distillation, and will find applications in quantum metrology and communications.},

Unfortunately, a practical QKD system may contain overlooked imperfections and may thus violate some of the assumptions in the security proofs of QKD. It is important to explore these assumptions. One key assumption is that the sender (Alice) can prepare the required quantum states without errors. However, such an assumption may be violated in a practical QKD system. In this paper, we perform a proof-of-principle experiment to demonstrate a technically feasible 'intercept- and-resend' attack that exploits such a security loophole in a commercial 'plug {\&} play' QKD system. The resulting quantum bit error rate is 19.7{\%}, which is substantially lower than the well-known 25{\%} error rate for an intercept-and-resend attack in BB84. The attack we utilize is the phase-remapping attack (Fung et al 2007 Phys. Rev. A 75 32314) proposed by our group.},

We prove that this is possible using Q qubits of communication and E ebits of shared entanglement between Alice and Bob, provided that Q ges 1/2I(C; D|B) and Q + E ges H(C|B), proving the optimality of the Luo-Devetak outer bound. The optimal qubit rate provides the first known operational interpretation of quantum conditional mutual information. We also show how our protocol leads to a fully operational proof of strong subaddivity and uncover a general organizing principle, in analogy to thermodynamics, that underlies the optimal rates.},

  abstract      = {Finally, here is a modern, self-contained text on quantum information theory suitable for graduate-level courses. Developing the subject 'from the ground up' it covers classical results as well as major advances of the past decade. Beginning with an extensive overview of classical information theory suitable for the non-expert, the author then turns his attention to quantum mechanics for quantum information theory, and the important protocols of teleportation, super-dense coding and entanglement distribution. He develops all of the tools necessary for understanding important results in quantum information theory, including capacity theorems for classical, entanglement-assisted, private and quantum communication. The book also covers important recent developments such as superadditivity of private, coherent and Holevo information, and the superactivation of quantum capacity. This book will be warmly welcomed by the upcoming generation of quantum information theorists and the already established community of classical information theorists.},

  abstract      = {The six-state protocol is a discrete-variable protocol for quantum key distribution, that permits to tolerate a noisier channel than the BB84 protocol. In this work we provide a lower bound on the maximum achievable key rate of a practical implementation of the entanglement-based version of the six-state protocol. Regarding the experimental set-up we consider that the source is untrusted and the photon-number statistics is measured using photon-number-resolving detectors. We provide the formula for the key rate for a finite initial number of resources. As an illustration of the considered formalism, we calculate the key rate for the setting where the source produces entangled photon pairs via parametric down-conversion and the losses in the channel depend on the distance. As a result we find that the finite-key corrections for the considered scenario are not negligible and they should be considered in any practical analysis.},

  abstract      = {Even though randomness is an essential resource for many information processing tasks, it is not easily found in nature. The goal of randomness extraction is to distill (almost) perfect randomness from a weak source of randomness. When the source yields a classical string X, many extractor constructions are known. Yet, when considering a physical randomness source, X is itself ultimately the result of a measurement on an underlying quantum system. When characterizing the power of a source to supply randomness it is hence a natural question to ask, how much classical randomness we can extract from a quantum state. To tackle this question we here take on the study of quantum-to-classical randomness extractors (QC-extractors). We provide constructions of QC-extractors based on measurements in a full set of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), and certain single qubit measurements. As the first application, we show that any QC-extractor gives rise to entropic uncertainty relations with respect to quantum side information. Such relations were previously only known for two measurements. As the second application, we resolve the central open question in the noisy-storage model [Wehner et al., PRL 100, 220502 (2008)] by linking security to the quantum capacity of the adversary's storage device.},

  abstract      = {Quantum de Finetti theorems are a useful tool in the study of correlations in quantum multipartite states. In this paper we prove two new quantum de Finetti theorems, both showing that under tests formed by local measurements one can get a much improved error dependence on the dimension of the subsystems. We also obtain similar results for non-signaling probability distributions. We give the following applications of the results: We prove the optimality of the Chen-Drucker protocol for 3-SAT, under the exponential time hypothesis. We show that the maximum winning probability of free games can be estimated in polynomial time by linear programming. We also show that 3-SAT with m variables can be reduced to obtaining a constant error approximation of the maximum winning probability under entangled strategies of O(m{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}})-player one-round non-local games, in which the players communicate O(m{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}}) bits all together. We show that the optimization of certain polynomials over the hypersphere can be performed in quasipolynomial time in the number of variables n by considering O(log(n)) rounds of the Sum-of-Squares (Parrilo/Lasserre) hierarchy of semidefinite programs. As an application to entanglement theory, we find a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for deciding multipartite separability. We consider a result due to Aaronson -- showing that given an unknown n qubit state one can perform tomography that works well for most observables by measuring only O(n) independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of the state -- and relax the assumption of having i.i.d copies of the state to merely the ability to select subsystems at random from a quantum multipartite state. The proofs of the new quantum de Finetti theorems are based on information theory, in particular on the chain rule of mutual information.},

  abstract      = {The local Hamiltonian problem consists of estimating the ground-state energy (given by the minimum eigenvalue) of a local quantum Hamiltonian. First, we show the existence of a good product-state approximation for the ground-state energy of 2-local Hamiltonians with one or more of the following properties: (1) high degree, (2) small expansion, or (3) a ground state with sublinear entanglement with respect to some partition into small pieces. The approximation based on degree is a surprising difference between quantum Hamiltonians and classical CSPs (constraint satisfaction problems), since in the classical setting, higher degree is usually associated with harder CSPs. The approximation based on low entanglement, in turn, was previously known only in the regime where the entanglement was close to zero. Since the existence of a low-energy product state can be checked in NP, the result implies that any Hamiltonian used for a quantum PCP theorem should have: (1) constant degree, (2) constant expansion, (3) a "volume law" for entanglement with respect to any partition into small parts. Second, we show that in several cases, good product-state approximations not only exist, but can be found in polynomial time: (1) 2-local Hamiltonians on any planar graph, solving an open problem of Bansal, Bravyi, and Terhal, (2) dense k-local Hamiltonians for any constant k, solving an open problem of Gharibian and Kempe, and (3) 2-local Hamiltonians on graphs with low threshold rank, via a quantum generalization of a recent result of Barak, Raghavendra and Steurer. Our work introduces two new tools which may be of independent interest. First, we prove a new quantum version of the de Finetti theorem which does not require the usual assumption of symmetry. Second, we describe a way to analyze the application of the Lasserre/Parrilo SDP hierarchy to local quantum Hamiltonians.},

  abstract      = {We propose a novel paradigm for defining security of cryptographic protocols, called universally composable security. The salient property of universally composable definitions of security is that they guarantee security even when a secure protocol is composed of an arbitrary set of protocols, or more generally when the protocol is used as a component of an arbitrary system. This is an essential property for maintaining security of cryptographic protocols in complex and unpredictable environments such as the Internet. In particular, universally composable definitions guarantee security even when an unbounded number of protocol instances are executed concurrently in an adversarially controlled manner, they guarantee non-malleability with respect to arbitrary protocols, and more. We show how to formulate universally composable definitions of security for practically any cryptographic task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that practically any such definition can be realized using known techniques, as long as only a minority of the participants are corrupted. We then proceed to formulate universally composable definitions of a wide array of cryptographic tasks, including authenticated and secure communication, key-exchange, public-key encryption, signature, commitment, oblivious transfer, zero knowledge and more. We also make initial steps towards studying the realizability of the proposed definitions in various settings.},

  abstract      = {We derive a new entropic quantum uncertainty relation involving min-entropy. The relation is tight and can be applied in various quantum-cryptographic settings. Protocols for quantum 1-out-of-2 Oblivious Transfer and quantum Bit Commitment are presented and the uncertainty relation is used to prove the security of these protocols in the bounded quantum-storage model according to new strong security definitions. As another application, we consider the realistic setting of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) against quantum-memory-bounded eavesdroppers. The uncertainty relation allows to prove the security of QKD protocols in this setting while tolerating considerably higher error rates compared to the standard model with unbounded adversaries. For instance, for the six-state protocol with one-way communication, a bit-flip error rate of up to 17{\%} can be tolerated (compared to 13{\%} in the standard model). Our uncertainty relation also yields a lower bound on the min-entropy key uncertainty against known-plaintext attacks when quantum ciphers are composed. Previously, the key uncertainty of these ciphers was only known with respect to Shannon entropy.},

  abstract      = {We give near-optimal constructions of extractors secure against quantum bounded-storage adversaries. One instantiation gives the first such extractor to achieve an output length Theta(K-b), where K is the source's entropy and b the adversary's storage, depending linearly on the adversary's amount of storage, together with a poly-logarithmic seed length. Another instantiation achieves a logarithmic key length, with a slightly smaller output length Theta((K-b)/K{\^{}}g) for any g>0. In contrast, the previous best construction [Ta-Shma, STOC'09] could only extract (K/b){\^{}}(1/15) bits. Our construction follows Trevisan's general reconstruction paradigm, and in fact our proof of security shows that essentially all extractors constructed using this paradigm are secure against quantum storage, with optimal parameters. Our argument is based on bounds for a generalization of quantum random access codes, which we call quantum functional access codes. This is crucial as it lets us avoid the local list-decoding algorithm central to the approach in [Ta-Shma, STOC'09] which was the source of the multiplicative overhead. Some of our constructions have the additional advantage that every bit of the output is a function of only a polylogarithmic number of bits from the source, which is crucial for some cryptographic applications.},

  abstract      = {A natural measure for the amount of quantum information that a physical system E holds about another system A = A{\_}1,...,A{\_}n is given by the min-entropy Hmin(A|E). Specifically, the min-entropy measures the amount of entanglement between E and A, and is the relevant measure when analyzing a wide variety of problems ranging from randomness extraction in quantum cryptography, decoupling used in channel coding, to physical processes such as thermalization or the thermodynamic work cost (or gain) of erasing a quantum system. As such, it is a central question to determine the behaviour of the min-entropy after some process M is applied to the system A. Here we introduce a new generic tool relating the resulting min-entropy to the original one, and apply it to several settings of interest, including sampling of subsystems and measuring in a randomly chosen basis. The sampling results lead to new upper bounds on quantum random access codes, and imply the existence of "local decouplers". The results on random measurements yield new high-order entropic uncertainty relations with which we prove the optimality of cryptographic schemes in the bounded quantum storage model.},

It is an essential component in every key agreement protocol where the key has to be transmitted through a noisy channel. The typical case is in the satellite scenario described by Maurer in the early 90's. Recently the need has arisen in relation with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols, where it is very important not to reveal unnecessary information in order to maximize the shared key length. In this paper we present an information reconciliation protocol based on a rate compatible construction of Low Density Parity Check codes. Our protocol improves the efficiency of the reconciliation for the whole range of error rates in the discrete variable QKD context. Its adaptability together with its low interactivity makes it specially well suited for QKD reconciliation.},

  abstract      = {Randomness extraction is of fundamental importance for information-theoretic cryptography. It allows to transform a raw key about which an attacker has some limited knowledge into a fully secure random key, on which the attacker has essentially no information. Up to date, only very few randomness-extraction techniques are known to work against an attacker holding quantum information on the raw key. This is very much in contrast to the classical (non-quantum) setting, which is much better understood and for which a vast amount of different techniques are known and proven to work. We prove a new randomness-extraction technique, which is known to work in the classical setting, to be secure against a quantum attacker as well. Randomness extraction is done by XOR'ing a so-called delta-biased mask to the raw key. Our result allows to extend the classical applications of this extractor to the quantum setting. We discuss the following two applications. We show how to encrypt a long message with a short key, information-theoretically secure against a quantum attacker, provided that the attacker has enough quantum uncertainty on the message. This generalizes the concept of entropically-secure encryption to the case of a quantum attacker. As second application, we show how to do error-correction without leaking partial information to a quantum attacker. Such a technique is useful in settings where the raw key may contain errors, since standard error-correction techniques may provide the attacker with information on, say, a secret key that was used to obtain the raw key.},

  abstract      = {Quantum key distribution, first proposed by C.H. Bennett and G. Brassard (1984), provides a possible key distribution scheme whose security depends only on the quantum laws of physics. So far the protocol has been proved secure even under channel noise and detector faults of the receiver but is vulnerable if the photon source used is imperfect. In this paper we propose and give a concrete design for a new concept, self-checking source, which requires the manufacturer of the photon source to provide certain tests; these tests are designed such that, if passed, the source is guaranteed to be adequate for the security of the quantum key distribution protocol, even though the testing devices may not be built to the original specification. The main mathematical result is a structural theorem which states that, for any state in a Hilbert space, if certain EPR-type equations are satisfied, the state must be essentially the orthogonal sum of EPR pairs},

Previous work was limited to performing computations and protocols in real Hilbert spaces, which is not a serious obstacle if one is only interested in final measurement statistics being correct (for example, getting the correct factors of a large number after running Shor's factoring algorithm). This limitation was shown by McKague et al. to be fundamental, since there is no way to experimentally distinguish any quantum experiment from a special simulation using states and operators with only real coefficients. In this paper, we show that one can still do a meaningful self-test of quantum apparatus with complex amplitudes. In particular, we define a family of simulations of quantum experiments, based on complex conjugation, with two interesting properties. First, we are able to define a self-test which may be passed only by states and operators that are equivalent to simulations within the family. This extends work of Mayers and Yao and Magniez et al. in self-testing of quantum apparatus, and includes a complex measurement. Second, any of the simulations in the family may be used to implement a secure 6-state QKD protocol, which was previously not known to be implementable in a self-tested framework.},

A wide range of applications critically rely on abundant, high quality random numbers generated securely. Here we show how to expand a random seed at an exponential rate without trusting the underlying quantum devices. Our approach is secure against the most general adversaries, and has the following new features: cryptographic quality output security, tolerating a constant level of implementation imprecision, requiring only a constant size quantum memory for the honest implementation, and allowing a large natural class of constructions. In conjunct with a recent work by Chung, Shi and Wu (QIP 2014), it also leads to robust unbounded expansion using just 2 multi-part devices. When adapted for distributing cryptographic keys, our method achieves, for the first time, exponential expansion combined with cryptographic security and noise tolerance. The proof proceeds by showing that the Renyi divergence of the outputs of the protocol (for a specific bounding operator) decreases linearly as the protocol iterates. At the heart of the proof are a new uncertainty principle on quantum measurements, and a method for simulating trusted measurements with untrusted devices.},

This enables modular proofs of security, which is essential in bridging the gap between the rigorous proof techniques of cryptography and tool-supported formal proof techniques. The model follows the general simulatability approach of modern cryptography. A variety of network structures and trust models can be described such as static and adaptive adversaries, some examples of this are given. As an example of our specification methodology we provide an abstract and complete specification for Secure Message Transmission, improving on recent results by Lynch (1999), and verify one concrete implementation. Our proof is based on a general theorem on the security of encryption in a reactive multi-user setting, generalizing a recent result by Bellare et. al (2000)},

This is in contrast to most of the standard results on the security of QKD, which only hold in the limit where the number of transmitted signals approaches infinity. Here, we analyze the security of QKD under the realistic assumption that the amount of communication is finite. At the level of the general formalism, we present new results that help simplifying the actual implementation of QKD protocols: in particular, we show that symmetrization steps, which are required by certain security proofs (e.g., proofs based on de Finetti's representation theorem), can be omitted in practical implementations. Also, we demonstrate how two-way reconciliation protocols can be taken into account in the security analysis. At the level of numerical estimates, we present the bounds with finite resources for ``device-independent security'' against collective attacks.},

This provides a simple technique for generating powerful upper bounds on the capacities of a general quantum channel. We apply this technique to two qubit channels of particular interest-the depolarizing channel and the channel with independent phase and amplitude noise. Our study of the latter demonstrates that the key rate of BB84 with one-way post-processing and quantum bit error rate q cannot exceed H(1/2-2q(1-q))-H(2q(1-q)).},

In particular, we give a new, simulation-based, definition for security in the bounded-quantum-storage model, and show that this definition allows for sequential composition of protocols. Damgard et al. (FOCS '05, CRYPTO '07) showed how to securely implement bit commitment and oblivious transfer in the bounded-quantum-storage model, where the adversary is only allowed to store a limited number of qubits. However, their security definitions did only apply to the standalone setting, and it was not clear if their protocols could be composed. Indeed, we first give a simple attack that shows that these protocols are not composable without a small refinement of the model. Finally, we prove the security of their randomized oblivious transfer protocol in our refined model. Secure implementations of oblivious transfer and bit commitment then follow easily by a (classical) reduction to randomized oblivious transfer.},

The bounds are stronger than these obtained with use of the entropic uncertainty relation by Maassen and Uffink, and they are optimal up to additive constants. We also analyze the case of a large number of measurements and obtain strong entropic uncertainty relations which hold with high probability with respect to the random choice of bases. The lower bounds we obtain are optimal up to additive constants and allow us to establish the conjecture by Wehner and Winter on the asymptotic behavior of constants in entropic uncertainty relations as the dimension tends to infinity. As a tool we develop estimates on the maximum operator norm of a submatrix of a fixed size of a random unitary matrix distributed according to the Haar measure, which are of an independent interest.},

@misc{gour15,
  abstract      = {The uncertainty principle, which states that certain sets of quantum-mechanical measurements have a minimal joint uncertainty, has many applications in quantum cryptography. But in such applications, it is important to consider the effect of a (sometimes adversarially controlled) memory that can be correlated with the system being measured: The information retained by such a memory can in fact diminish the uncertainty of measurements. Uncertainty conditioned on a memory was considered in the past by Berta et al. (Ref. 1), who found a specific uncertainty relation in terms of the von Neumann conditional entropy. But this entropy is not the only measure that can be used to quantify conditional uncertainty. In the spirit of recent work by several groups (Refs. 2--6), here we develop a general operational framework that formalizes the concept of conditional uncertainty in a measure-independent form. Our formalism is built around a mathematical relation that we call conditional majorization. We define and characterize conditional majorization, and use it to develop tools for the construction of measures of the conditional uncertainty of individual measurements, and also of the joint conditional uncertainty of sets of measurements. We demonstrate the use of this framework by deriving measure-independent conditional uncertainty relations of two types: (1) A lower bound on the minimal joint uncertainty that two remote parties (Bob and Eve) have about the outcome of a given pair of measurements performed by a third remote party (Alice), conditioned on arbitrary measurements that Bob and Eve make on their own systems. This lower bound is independent of the initial state shared by the three parties; (2) An initial state--dependent lower bound on the minimal joint uncertainty that Bob has about Alice's pair of measurements in a bipartite setting, conditioned on Bob's quantum system.},

  abstract      = {Quantum information theory studies the fundamental limits that physical laws impose on information processing tasks such as data compression and data transmission on noisy channels. This thesis presents general techniques that allow one to solve many fundamental problems of quantum information theory in a unified framework. The central theorem of this thesis proves the existence of a protocol that transmits quantum data that is partially known to the receiver through a single use of an arbitrary noisy quantum channel. In addition to the intrinsic interest of this problem, this theorem has as immediate corollaries several central theorems of quantum information theory. The following chapters use this theorem to prove the existence of new protocols for two other types of quantum channels, namely quantum broadcast channels and quantum channels with side information at the transmitter. These protocols also involve sending quantum information partially known by the receiver with a single use of the channel, and have as corollaries entanglement-assisted and unassisted asymptotic coding theorems. The entanglement-assisted asymptotic versions can, in both cases, be considered as quantum versions of the best coding theorems known for the classical versions of these problems. The last chapter deals with a purely quantum phenomenon called locking. We demonstrate that it is possible to encode a classical message into a quantum state such that, by removing a subsystem of logarithmic size with respect to its total size, no measurement can have significant correlations with the message. The message is therefore "locked" by a logarithmic-size key. This thesis presents the first locking protocol for which the success criterion is that the trace distance between the joint distribution of the message and the measurement result and the product of their marginals be sufficiently small.},

  abstract      = {Uncertainty relations express the fundamental incompatibility of certain observables in quantum mechanics. Far from just being puzzling constraints on our ability to know the state of a quantum system, uncertainty relations are at the heart of why some classically impossible cryptographic primitives become possible when quantum communication is allowed. This thesis is concerned with strong notions of uncertainty relations and their applications in quantum information theory. One operational manifestation of such uncertainty relations is a purely quantum effect referred to as information locking. A locking scheme can be viewed as a cryptographic protocol in which a uniformly random n-bit message is encoded in a quantum system using a classical key of size much smaller than n. Without the key, no measurement of this quantum state can extract more than a negligible amount of information about the message, in which case the message is said to be "locked". Furthermore, knowing the key, it is possible to recover, that is "unlock", the message. We give new efficient constructions of bases satisfying strong uncertainty relations leading to the first explicit construction of an information locking scheme. We also give several other applications of our uncertainty relations both to cryptographic and communication tasks. In addition, we define objects called QC-extractors, that can be seen as strong uncertainty relations that hold against quantum adversaries. We provide several constructions of QC-extractors, and use them to prove the security of cryptographic protocols for two-party computations based on the sole assumption that the parties' storage device is limited in transmitting quantum information. In doing so, we resolve a central question in the so-called noisy-storage model by relating security to the quantum capacity of storage devices.},

  abstract      = {This document focuses on translating various information-theoretic measures
of distinguishability for probability distributions into measures of distin-
guishability for quantum states. These measures should have important appli-
cations in quantum cryptography and quantum computation theory. The results
reported include the following. An exact expression for the quantum fidelity
between two mixed states is derived. The optimal measurement that gives rise to
it is studied in detail. Several upper and lower bounds on the quantum mutual
information are derived via similar techniques and compared to each other. Of
note is a simple derivation of the important upper bound first proved by Holevo
and an explicit expression for another (tighter) upper bound that appears
implicitly in the same derivation. Several upper and lower bounds to the quan-
tum Kullback relative information are derived. The measures developed are also
applied to ferreting out the extent to which quantum systems must be disturbed
by information gathering measurements. This is tackled in two ways. The first
is in setting up a general formalism for describing the tradeoff between
inference and disturbance. The main point of this is that it gives a way of
expressing the problem so that it appears as algebraic as that of the problem
of finding quantum distinguishability measures. The second result on this theme
is a theorem that prohibits "broadcasting" an unknown (mixed) quantum state.
That is to say, there is no way to replicate an unknown quantum state onto two
separate quantum systems when each system is considered without regard to the
other. This includes the possibility of correlation or quantum entanglement
between the systems. This result is a significant extension and generalization
of the standard "no-cloning" theorem for pure states.},

  abstract      = {Network information theory is the study of communication problems involving multiple senders, multiple receivers and intermediate relay stations. The purpose of this thesis is to extend the main ideas of classical network information theory to the study of classical-quantum channels. We prove coding theorems for quantum multiple access channels, quantum interference channels, quantum broadcast channels and quantum relay channels. A quantum model for a communication channel describes more accurately the channel's ability to transmit information. By using physically faithful models for the channel outputs and the detection procedure, we obtain better communication rates than would be possible using a classical strategy. In this thesis, we are interested in the transmission of classical information, so we restrict our attention to the study of classical-quantum channels. These are channels with classical inputs and quantum outputs, and so the coding theorems we present will use classical encoding and quantum decoding. We study the asymptotic regime where many copies of the channel are used in parallel, and the uses are assumed to be independent. In this context, we can exploit information-theoretic techniques to calculate the maximum rates for error-free communication for any channel, given the statistics of the noise on that channel. These theoretical bounds can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the rates achieved by practical communication protocols. Most of the results in this thesis consider classical-quantum channels with finite dimensional output systems, which are analogous to classical discrete memoryless channels. In the last chapter, we will show some applications of our results to a practical optical communication scenario, in which the information is encoded in continuous quantum degrees of freedom, which are analogous to classical channels with Gaussian noise.},

  abstract      = {This thesis initiates the study of cryptographic protocols in the bounded-quantum-storage model. On the practical side, simple protocols for Rabin Oblivious Transfer, 1-2 Oblivious Transfer and Bit Commitment are presented. No quantum memory is required for honest players, whereas the protocols can only be broken by an adversary controlling a large amount of quantum memory. The protocols are efficient, non-interactive and can be implemented with today's technology. On the theoretical side, new entropic uncertainty relations involving min-entropy are established and used to prove the security of protocols according to new strong security definitions. For instance, in the realistic setting of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) against quantum-memory-bounded eavesdroppers, the uncertainty relation allows to prove the security of QKD protocols while tolerating considerably higher error rates compared to the standard model with unbounded adversaries.},

We investigate the conditional min- and max-entropy for quantum states, generalizations of classical R$\backslash$'enyi entropies. We introduce the purified distance, a novel metric for unnormalized quantum states and use it to define smooth entropies as optimizations of the min- and max-entropies over a ball of close states. We explore various properties of these entropies, including data-processing inequalities, chain rules and their classical limits. The most important property is an entropic formulation of the asymptotic equipartition property, which implies that the smooth entropies converge to the von Neumann entropy in the limit of many independent copies. The smooth entropies also satisfy duality and entropic uncertainty relations that provide limits on the power of two different observers to predict the outcome of a measurement on a quantum system. Finally, we discuss three example applications of the smooth entropy framework. We show a strong converse statement for source coding with quantum side information, characterize randomness extraction against quantum side information and prove information theoretic security of quantum key distribution using an intuitive argument based on the entropic uncertainty relation.},

Shor's discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for factoring large integers implies that many existing classical systems based on computational assumptions can be broken, once a quantum computer is built. It is therefore imperative to find other means of implementing secure protocols. This thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of both the physical limitations, as well as the possibilities of cryptography in the quantum setting. In particular, we investigate several questions that are crucial to the security of quantum protocols: How can we find good uncertainty relations for a large number of measurement settings? How does the presence of entanglement affect classical protocols? And, what limitations does entanglement impose on implementing quantum protocols? Finally, can we circumvent some of those limitations using realistic assumptions?},

As a by-product we obtain a new proof of the famous Holevo bound. Then multi-user systems are investigated, and the capacity region for the quantum multiple access channel is determined.
